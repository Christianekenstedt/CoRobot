services in the internal market amending directives 97/7/ec 2002/65/ec 2005/60/ec and 2006/48/ec and repealing directive 97/5/ec text with eea relevance the european parliament and the council of the european union having regard to the treaty establishing the european community and in particular the first and third sentences of article 47 2 and article 95 thereof having regard to the proposal from the commission having consulted the european economic and social committee having regard to the opinion of the european central bank 1 acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in article 251 of the treaty 2 whereas 1 it is essential for the establishment of the internal market that all internal frontiers in the community be dismantled so as to enable the free movement of goods persons services and capital the proper operation of the single market in payment services is therefore vital at present however the lack of harmonisation in this area hinders the operation of that market 2 currently the payment services markets of the member states are organised separately along national lines and the legal framework for payment services is fragmented into 27 national legal systems 3 several community acts have already been adopted in this area namely directive 97/5/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 27 january 1997 on cross-border credit transfers 3 and regulation ec no 2560/2001 of the european parliament and of the council of 19 december 2001 on cross-border payments in euro 4 but these have not sufficiently remedied this situation any more than have commission recommendation 87/598/eec of 8 december 1987 on a european code of conduct relating to electronic payment relations between financial institutions traders and service establishments and consumers 5 commission recommendation 88/590/eec of 17 november 1988 concerning payment systems and in particular the relationship between cardholder and card issuer 6 or commission recommendation 97/489/ec of 30 july 1997 concerning transactions by electronic payment instruments and in particular the relationship between issuer and holder 7 these measures continue to be insufficient the co-existence of national provisions and an incomplete community framework gives rise to confusion and a lack of legal certainty 4 it is vital therefore to establish at community level a modern and coherent legal framework for payment services whether or not the services are compatible with the system resulting from the financial sector initiative for a single euro payments area which is neutral so as to ensure a level playing field for all payment systems in order to maintain consumer choice which should mean a considerable step forward in terms of consumer cost safety and efficiency as compared with the present national systems 5 that legal framework should ensure the coordination of national provisions on prudential requirements the access of new payment service providers to the market information requirements and the respective rights and obligations of payment services users and providers within that framework the provisions of regulation ec no 2560/2001 which created a single market for euro payments as far as prices are concerned should be maintained the provisions of directive 97/5/ec and the recommendations made in recommendations 87/598/eec 88/590/eec and 97/489/ec should be integrated in a single act with binding force 6 however it is not appropriate for that legal framework to be fully comprehensive its application should be confined to payment service providers whose main activity consists in the provision of payment services to payment service users nor is it appropriate for it to apply to services where the transfer of funds from the payer to the payee or their transport is executed solely in bank notes and coins or where the transfer is based on a paper cheque paper-based bill of exchange promissory note or other instrument paper-based vouchers or cards drawn upon a payment service provider or other party with a view to placing funds at the disposal of the payee furthermore a differentiation should be made in the case of means offered by telecommunication information technology or network operators to facilitate purchasing of digital goods or services such as ring tones music or digital newspapers besides traditional voice services and their distribution to digital devices the content of these goods or services may be produced either by a third party or by the operator who may add intrinsic value to them in the form of access distribution or search facilities in the latter case where the goods or services are distributed by one of those operators or for technical reasons by a third party and where they can be used only through digital devices such as mobile phones or computers that legal framework should not apply as the activity of the operator goes beyond a mere payment transaction however it is appropriate for that legal framework to apply to cases where the operator acts only as an intermediary who simply arranges for payment to be made to a third-party supplier 7 money remittance is a simple payment service that is usually based on cash provided by a payer to a payment service provider which remits the corresponding amount for example via communication network to a payee or to another payment service provider acting on behalf of the payee in some member states supermarkets merchants and other retailers provide to the public a corresponding service enabling the payment of utility and other regular household bills those bill-paying services should be treated as money remittance as defined in this directive unless the competent authorities consider the activity to fall under another payment service listed in the annex 8 it is necessary to specify the categories of payment service providers which may legitimately provide payment services throughout the community namely credit institutions which take deposits from users that can be used to fund payment transactions and which should continue to be subject to the prudential requirements under directive 2006/48/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 14 june 2006 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions 8 electronic money institutions which issue electronic money that can be used to fund payment transactions and which should continue to be subject to the prudential requirements under directive 2000/46/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 18 september 2000 on the taking-up pursuit and prudential supervision of the business of electronic money institutions 9 and post office giro institutions which are so entitled under national law 9 this directive should lay down rules on the execution of payment transactions where the funds are electronic money as defined in article 1 3 b of directive 2000/46/ec this directive should however neither regulate issuance of electronic money nor amend the prudential regulation of electronic money institutions as provided for in directive 2000/46/ec therefore payment institutions should not be allowed to issue electronic money 10 however in order to remove legal barriers to market entry it is necessary to establish a single licence for all providers of payment services which are not connected to taking deposits or issuing electronic money it is appropriate therefore to introduce a new category of payment service providers ‘ payment institutions ’ by providing for the authorisation subject to a set of strict and comprehensive conditions of legal persons outside the existing categories to provide payment services throughout the community thus the same conditions would apply community-wide to such services 11 the conditions for granting and maintaining authorisation as payment institutions should include prudential requirements proportionate to the operational and financial risks faced by such bodies in the course of their business in this connection there is a need for a sound regime of initial capital combined with ongoing capital which could be elaborated in a more sophisticated way in due course depending on the needs of the market due to the range of variety in the payments services area this directive should allow various methods combined with a certain range of supervisory discretion to ensure that the same risks are treated the same way for all payment service providers the requirements for the payment institutions should reflect the fact that payment institutions engage in more specialised and limited activities thus generating risks that are narrower and easier to monitor and control than those that arise across the broader spectrum of activities of credit institutions in particular payment institutions should be prohibited from accepting deposits from users and permitted to use funds received from users only for rendering payment services provision should be made for client funds to be kept separate from the payment institution 's funds for other business activities payment institutions should also be made subject to effective anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing requirements 12 payment institutions should draw up their annual and consolidated accounts in accordance with council directive 78/660/eec of 25 july 1978 on the annual accounts of certain types of companies 10 and where applicable council directive 83/349/eec of 13 june 1983 on consolidated accounts 11 and council directive 86/635/eec of 8 december 1986 on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of banks and other financial institutions 12 the annual accounts and consolidated accounts should be audited unless the payment institution is exempted from this obligation under directive 78/660/eec and where applicable directives 83/349/eec and 86/635/eec 13 this directive should regulate the granting of credit by payment institutions i.e the granting of credit lines and the issuance of credit cards only where it is closely linked to payment services only if credit is granted in order to facilitate payment services and such credit is of a short-term nature and is granted for a period not exceeding twelve months including on a revolving basis is it appropriate to allow payment institutions to grant such credit with regard to their cross-border activities on condition that it is refinanced using mainly the payment institution 's own funds as well as other funds from the capital markets but not the funds held on behalf of clients for payment services the above should be without prejudice to council directive 87/102/eec of 22 december 1986 for the approximation of the laws regulations and administrative provisions of the member states concerning consumer credit 13 or other relevant community or national legislation regarding conditions for granting credit to consumers not harmonised by this directive 14 it is necessary for the member states to designate the authorities responsible for granting authorisations to payment institutions carrying out controls and deciding on the withdrawal of those authorisations in order to ensure equality of treatment member states should apply to payment institutions no requirements other than those provided for in this directive however all decisions made by the competent authorities should be contestable before the courts in addition the tasks of the competent authorities should be without prejudice to the oversight of payment systems which in line with the fourth indent of article 105 2 of the treaty is a task to be carried out by the european system of central banks 15 given the desirability of registering the identity and whereabouts of all persons providing remittance services and of according them all a measure of acceptance irrespective of whether they are able to meet the full range of conditions for authorisation as payment institutions so that none are forced into the black economy and bring all persons providing remittance service within the ambit of certain minimum legal and regulatory requirements it is appropriate and in line with the rationale of special recommendation vi of the financial action task force on money laundering to provide a mechanism whereby payment service providers unable to meet all those conditions may nevertheless be treated as payment institutions for those purposes member states should enter such persons in the register of payment institutions while not applying all or part of the conditions for authorisation however it is essential to make the possibility of waiver subject to strict requirements relating to the volume of payment transactions payment institutions benefiting from a waiver should have neither the right of establishment nor the freedom to provide services nor should they indirectly exercise those rights when being a member of a payment system 16 it is essential for any payment service provider to be able to access the services of technical infrastructures of payment systems such access should however be subject to appropriate requirements in order to ensure integrity and stability of those systems each payment service provider applying for a participation in a payment system should furnish proof to the participants of the payment system that its internal arrangements are sufficiently robust against all kinds of risk these payment systems typically include e.g the four-party card schemes as well as major systems processing credit transfers and direct debits in order to ensure equality of treatment throughout the community as between the different categories of authorised payment service providers according to the terms of their licence it is necessary to clarify the rules concerning access to the provision of payment services and access to payment systems provision should be made for the non-discriminatory treatment of authorised payment institutions and credit institutions so that any payment service provider competing in the internal market is able to use the services of the technical infrastructures of these payment systems under the same conditions it is appropriate to provide for different treatment for authorised payment service providers and for those benefiting from a waiver under this directive as well as from the waiver under the article 8 of the directive 2000/46/ec due to the differences in their prudential framework in any case differences in price conditions should be allowed only when this is motivated by differences in costs induced by the payment service providers this should be without prejudice to member states right to limit access to systemically important systems in accordance with directive 98/26/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 19 may 1998 on settlement finality in payment and securities settlement systems 14 and without prejudice to the competence of the european central bank and the european system of central banks escb as laid down in article 105 2 of the treaty and article 3 1 and article 22 of the statute of the escb concerning access to payment systems 17 the provisions of the access to payment systems should not apply to systems set up and operated by a single payment service provider those payment systems can operate either in direct competition to payment systems or more typically in a market niche not adequately covered by payment systems they typically cover three-party schemes such as three party card schemes payment services offered by telecommunication providers or money remittance services where the scheme operator is the payment service provider to both the payer and payee as well as internal systems of banking groups in order to stimulate the competition that can be provided by such payment systems to established mainstream payment systems it should in principle not be appropriate to grant third parties access to these payment systems nevertheless such systems should always be subject to community and national competition rules which may require that access be granted to the schemes in order to maintain effective competition in payments markets 18 a set of rules should be established in order to ensure transparency of conditions and information requirements for payment services 19 this directive should apply neither to payment transactions made in cash since a single payments market for cash already exists nor to payment transactions based on paper cheques since by their nature they can not be processed as efficiently as other means of payment good practice in this area should however be based on the principles set out in this directive 20 as consumers and enterprises are not in the same position they do not need the same level of protection while it is important to guarantee consumers rights by provisions which can not be derogated from by contract it is reasonable to let enterprises and organisations agree otherwise however member states should have the possibility to provide that micro-enterprises as defined by commission recommendation 2003/361/ec of 6 may 2003 concerning the definition of micro small and medium-sized enterprises 15 should be treated in the same way as consumers in any case certain core provisions of this directive should always be applicable irrespective of the status of the user 21 this directive should specify the obligations on payment service providers as regards the provision of information to the payment service users who should receive the same high level of clear information about payment services in order to make well-informed choices and be able to shop around within the eu in the interest of transparency this directive should lay down the harmonised requirements needed to ensure that necessary and sufficient information is given to the payment service users with regard to the payment service contract and the payment transactions in order to promote smooth functioning of the single market in payment services member states should be able to adopt only those information provisions laid down in this directive 22 consumers should be protected against unfair and misleading practices in line with directive 2005/29/ec of the european parliament and the council of 11 may 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market 16 as well as directive 2000/31/ec of the european parliament and the council of 8 june 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services in particular electronic commerce in the internal market directive on electronic commerce 17 and directive 2002/65/ec of the european parliament and the council of 23 september 2002 concerning the distance marketing of consumer financial services 18 the additional provisions in those directives continue to be applicable however the relationship of the pre-contractual information requirements between this directive and directive 2002/65/ec should in particular be clarified 23 the information required should be proportionate to the needs of users and communicated in a standard manner however the information requirements for a single payment transaction should be different from those of a framework contract which provides for the series of payment transactions 24 in practice framework contracts and the payment transactions covered by them are far more common and economically important than single payment transactions if there is a payment account or a specific payment instrument a framework contract is required therefore the requirements for prior information on framework contracts should be quite comprehensive and information should always be provided on paper or on another durable medium such as printouts by account printers floppy disks cd-roms dvds and hard drives of personal computers on which electronic mail can be stored and internet sites as long as such sites are accessible for future reference for a period of time adequate for the purposes of information and allow the unchanged reproduction of the information stored however it should be possible for the payment service provider and the payment service user to agree in the framework contract on the manner in which subsequent information on executed payment transactions is given for instance that in internet banking all information on the payment account is made available online 25 in single payment transactions only the essential information should always be given on the payment service provider 's own initiative as the payer is usually present when he gives the payment order it is not necessary to require that information should in every case be provided on paper or on another durable medium the payment service provider may give information orally over the counter or make it otherwise easily accessible for example by keeping the conditions on a notice board on the premises information should also be given on where other more detailed information is available e.g the address of the website however if the consumer so requests the essential information should be given on paper or on another durable medium 26 this directive should provide for the consumer 's right to receive relevant information free of charge before he is bound by any payment service contract the consumer should also be able to request prior information as well as the framework contract on paper free of charge at any time during the contractual relationship so as to enable him to compare payment service providers services and their conditions and in case of any dispute verify his contractual rights and obligations those provisions should be compatible with directive 2002/65/ec the explicit provisions on free information in this directive should not have the effect of allowing charges to be imposed for the provision of information to consumers under other applicable directives 27 the way in which the required information is to be given by the payment service provider to the payment service user should take into account the needs of the latter as well as practical technical aspects and cost-efficiency depending on the situation with regard to the agreement in the respective payment service contract thus this directive should distinguish between two ways in which information is to be given by the payment service provider either the information should be provided i.e actively communicated by the payment service provider at the appropriate time as required by this directive without further prompting by the payment service user or the information should be made available to the payment service user taking into account any request he may have for further information in the latter case the payment service user should take some active steps in order to obtain the information such as requesting it explicitly from the payment service provider logging into bank account mail box or inserting a bank card into printer for account statements for such purposes the payment service provider should ensure that access to the information is possible and that the information is available to the payment service user 28 in addition the consumer should receive basic information on executed payment transactions for no additional charge in the case of a single payment transaction the payment service provider should not charge separately for this information similarly the subsequent monthly information on payment transactions under a framework contract should be given free of charge however taking into account the importance of transparency in pricing and differing customer needs the parties should be able to agree on charges for more frequent or additional information in order to take into account different national practices member states should be allowed to set rules requiring that monthly paper-based statements of payment accounts are always to be given free of charge 29 in order to facilitate customer mobility it should be possible for consumers to terminate a framework contract after the expiry of a year without incurring charges for consumers the period of notice agreed should be no longer than a month and for payment service providers no shorter than two months this directive should be without prejudice to the payment service provider 's obligation to terminate the payment service contract in exceptional circumstances under other relevant community or national legislation such as legislation on money laundering and terrorist financing any action targeting the freezing of funds or any specific measure linked to the prevention and investigation of crimes 30 low value payment instruments should be a cheap and easy-to-use alternative in the case of low-priced goods and services and should not be overburdened by excessive requirements the relevant information requirements and rules on their execution should therefore be limited to essential information taking also into account technical capabilities that can justifiably be expected from instruments dedicated to low value payments despite the lighter regime payment service users should benefit from adequate protection considering the limited risks posed by those payment instruments especially with regard to prepaid payment instruments 31 in order to reduce the risks and consequences of unauthorised or incorrectly executed payment transactions the payment service user should inform the payment service provider as soon as possible about any contestations concerning allegedly unauthorised or incorrectly executed payment transactions provided that the payment service provider has fulfilled his information obligations under this directive if the notification deadline is met by the payment service user he should be able to pursue those claims within the prescription periods pursuant to national law this directive should not affect other claims between payment service users and payment service providers 32 in order to provide an incentive for the payment service user to notify without undue delay his provider of any theft or loss of a payment instrument and thus to reduce the risk of unauthorised payment transactions the user should be liable only for a limited amount unless the payment service user has acted fraudulently or with gross negligence moreover once a user has notified a payment service provider that his payment instrument may have been compromised the user should not be required to cover any further losses stemming from unauthorised use of that instrument this directive should be without prejudice to the payment service providers responsibility for technical security of their own products 33 in order to assess possible negligence by the payment service user account should be taken of all the circumstances the evidence and degree of alleged negligence should be evaluated according to national law contractual terms and conditions relating to the provision and use of a payment instrument the effect of which would be to increase the burden of proof on the consumer or to reduce the burden of proof on the issuer should be considered null and void 34 however member states should be able to establish less stringent rules than mentioned above in order to maintain existing levels of consumer protection and promote trust in the safe usage of electronic payment instruments the fact that different payment instruments involve different risks should be taken into account accordingly thus promoting the issuance of safer instruments member states should be allowed to reduce or completely waive the payer 's liability except where the payer has acted fraudulently 35 provisions should be made for the allocation of losses in the case of unauthorised payment transactions different provisions may apply to payment service users who are not consumers since such users are normally in a better position to assess the risk of fraud and take countervailing measures 36 this directive should lay down rules for a refund to protect the consumer when the executed payment transaction exceeds the amount which could reasonably have been expected payment service providers should be able to provide even more favourable terms to their customers and for example refund any disputed payment transactions in cases where the user makes a claim for the refund of a payment transaction refund rights should affect neither the liability of the payer vis-à-vis the payee from the underlying relationship e.g for goods or services ordered consumed or legitimately charged nor the users rights with regard to revocation of a payment order 37 for financial planning and the fulfilment of payment obligations in due time consumers and enterprises need to have certainty on the length of time that the execution of a payment order takes therefore this directive should introduce a point in time at which rights and obligations take effect namely when the payment service provider receives the payment order including when he has had the opportunity to receive it through the means of communication agreed in the payment service contract notwithstanding any prior involvement in the process leading up to the creation and transmission of the payment order e.g security and availability of funds checks information on the use of the personal identity number or issuance of a payment promise furthermore the receipt of a payment order should occur when the payer 's payment service provider receives the payment order to be debited from the payer 's account the day or moment in time when a payee transmits to his service provider payment orders for the collection e.g of card payment or of direct debits or when the payee is granted a pre-financing on the related amounts by his payment service provider by way of a contingent credit to his account should have no relevance in this respect users should be able to rely on the proper execution of a complete and valid payment order if the payment service provider has no contractual or statutory ground for refusal if the payment service provider refuses a payment order the refusal and the reason therefor should be communicated to the payment service user at the earliest opportunity subject to the requirements of community and national law 38 in view of the speed with which modern fully automated payment systems process payment transactions which means that after a certain point in time payment orders can not be revoked without high manual intervention costs it is necessary to specify a clear deadline for payment revocations however depending on the type of the payment service and the payment order the point in time may be varied by agreement between the parties revocation in this context is applicable only to the relationship between a payment service user and payment service provider thus being without prejudice to the irrevocability and finality of payment transactions in payment systems 39 such irrevocability should not affect a payment service provider 's right or obligation under the laws of some member states based on the payer 's framework contract or national laws regulations administrative provisions or guidelines to reimburse the payer with the amount of the executed payment transaction in the event of a dispute between the payer and the payee such reimbursement should be considered to be a new payment order except for those cases legal disputes arising within the relationship underlying the payment order should be settled only between the payer and the payee 40 it is essential for the fully integrated straight-through processing of payments and for legal certainty with respect to the fulfilment of any underlying obligation between payment service users that the full amount transferred by the payer should be credited to the account of the payee accordingly it should not be possible for any of the intermediaries involved in the execution of payment transactions to make deductions from the amount transferred however it should be possible for the payee to enter into an agreement with his payment service provider under which the latter may deduct his own charges nevertheless in order to enable the payee to verify that the amount due is correctly paid subsequent information provided on the payment transaction should indicate not only the full amount of funds transferred but also the amount of any charges 41 with regard to charges experience has shown that the sharing of charges between a payer and a payee is the most efficient system since it facilitates the straight-through processing of payments provision should therefore be made for charges to be levied in the normal course directly on the payer and the payee by their respective payment service providers however that should apply only where the payment transaction does not require currency exchange the amount of any charges levied may also be zero as the provisions of this directive do not affect the practice whereby the payment service provider does not charge consumers for crediting their accounts similarly depending on the contract terms a payment service provider may charge only the payee merchant for the use of the payment service which has the effect that no charges are imposed on the payer the charging of the payment systems may be in the form of a subscription fee the provisions on the amount transferred or any charges levied have no direct impact on pricing between payment service providers or any intermediaries 42 in order to promote transparency and competition the payment service provider should not prevent the payee from requesting a charge from the payer for using a specific payment instrument while the payee should be free to levy charges for the use of a certain payment instrument member states may decide whether they forbid or limit any such practice where in their view this may be warranted in view of abusive pricing or pricing which may have a negative impact on the use of a certain payment instrument taking into account the need to encourage competition and the use of efficient payment instruments 43 in order to improve the efficiency of payments throughout the community all payment orders initiated by the payer and denominated in euro or the currency of a member state outside the euro area including credit transfers and money remittances should be subject to a maximum one-day execution time for all other payments such as payments initiated by or through a payee including direct debits and card payments in the absence of an explicit agreement between the payment service provider and the payer setting a longer execution time the same one-day execution time should apply the periods above could be extended by an additional business day if a payment order is given on paper this allows the continued provision of payment services for those consumers who are used to paper documents only when a direct debit scheme is used the payee 's payment service provider should transmit the collection order within the time limits agreed between the payee and his payment service provider enabling settlement at the agreed due date in view of the fact that national payment infrastructures are often highly efficient and in order to prevent any deterioration in current service levels member states should be allowed to maintain or set rules specifying an execution time shorter than one business day where appropriate 44 the provisions on execution for the full amount and execution time should constitute good practice where one of the service providers is not located in the community 45 it is essential for payment service users to know the real costs and charges of payment services in order to make their choice accordingly the use of non-transparent pricing methods should not be allowed since it is commonly accepted that those methods make it extremely difficult for users to establish the real price of the payment service specifically the use of value dating to the disadvantage of the user should not be permitted 46 the smooth and efficient functioning of the payment system depends on the user being able to rely on the payment service provider executing the payment transaction correctly and within the agreed time usually the provider is in the position to assess the risks involved in the payment transaction it is the provider that provides the payments system makes arrangements to recall misplaced or wrongly allocated funds and decides in most cases on the intermediaries involved in the execution of a payment transaction in view of all those considerations it is entirely appropriate except under abnormal and unforeseeable circumstances to impose liability on the payment service provider in respect of execution of a payment transaction accepted from the user except for the payee 's payment service provider 's acts and omissions for whose selection solely the payee is responsible however in order not to leave the payer unprotected in unlikely constellations where it may remain open non liquet whether the payment amount was duly received by the payee 's payment service provider or not the corresponding burden of proof should lie upon the payer 's payment service provider as a rule it can be expected that the intermediary institution usually a ‘ neutral ’ body like a central bank or a clearing house transferring the payment amount from the sending to the receiving payment service provider will store the account data and be able to furnish the latter whenever this may be necessary whenever the payment amount has been credited to the receiving payment service provider 's account the payee should immediately have a claim against his payment service provider for credit to his account 47 the payer 's payment service provider should assume liability for correct payment execution including in particular the full amount of the payment transaction and execution time and full responsibility for any failure by other parties in the payment chain up to the account of the payee as a result of that liability the payment service provider of the payer should where the full amount is not credited to the payee 's payment service provider correct the payment transaction or without undue delay refund to the payer the relevant amount of that transaction without prejudice to any other claims which may be made in accordance with national law this directive should concern only contractual obligations and responsibilities between the payment service user and his payment service provider however the proper functioning of credit transfers and other payment services requires that payment service providers and their intermediaries such as processors have contracts where their mutual rights and obligations are agreed upon questions related to liabilities form an essential part of these uniform contracts to ensure the reliability among payment service providers and intermediaries taking part in a payment transaction legal certainty is necessary to the effect that a non-responsible payment service provider is compensated for losses incurred or sums paid under the provisions of this directive relating to liability further rights and details of content of recourse and how to handle claims towards the payment service provider or intermediary attributable to a defective payment transaction should be left to be defined by contractual arrangements 48 it should be possible for the payment service provider to specify unambiguously the information required to execute a payment order correctly on the other hand however in order to avoid fragmentation and jeopardising the setting-up of integrated payment systems in the community member states should not be allowed to require a particular identifier to be used for payment transactions however this should not prevent member states from requiring the payment service provider of the payer to act in due diligence and verify where technically possible and without requiring manual intervention the coherence of the unique identifier and where the unique identifier is found to be incoherent to refuse the payment order and inform the payer thereof the liability of the payment service provider should be limited to the correct execution of the payment transaction in accordance with the payment order of the payment service user 49 in order to facilitate effective fraud prevention and combat payment fraud across the community provision should be made for the efficient exchange of data between payment service providers who should be allowed to collect process and exchange personal data relating to persons involved in payment fraud all those activities should be conducted in compliance with directive 95/46/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 24 october 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data 19 50 it is necessary to ensure the effective enforcement of the provisions of national law adopted pursuant to this directive appropriate procedures should therefore be established by means of which it will be possible to pursue complaints against payment service providers which do not comply with those provisions and to ensure that where appropriate effective proportionate and dissuasive penalties are imposed 51 without prejudice to the right of customers to bring action in the courts member states should ensure an easily accessible and cost-sensitive out-of-court resolution of conflicts between payment service providers and consumers arising from the rights and obligations set out in this directive article 5 2 of the rome convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations 20 ensures that the protection afforded to consumers by the mandatory rules of the law of the country in which they have their habitual residence may not be undermined by any contractual terms on law applicable 52 member states should determine whether the competent authorities designated for granting authorisation to payment institutions might also be the competent authorities with regard to out-of-court complaint and redress procedures 53 this directive should be without prejudice to provisions of national law relating to the consequences as regards liability of inaccuracy in the expression or transmission of a statement 54 since it is necessary to review the efficient functioning of this directive and to monitor progress on the establishment of a single payment market the commission should be required to produce a report three years after the end of the transposition period of this directive with regard to the global integration of financial services and harmonised consumer protection also beyond the efficient functioning of this directive focal points of the review should be the possible need to expand the scope of application with regard to non-eu currencies and to payment transactions where only one payment service provider concerned is located in the community 55 since the provisions of this directive replace those of directive 97/5/ec that directive should be repealed 56 it is necessary to lay down more detailed rules concerning the fraudulent use of payment cards an area currently covered by directive 97/7/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 20 may 1997 on the protection of consumers in respect of distance contracts 21 and directive 2002/65/ec those directives should therefore be amended accordingly 57 since pursuant to directive 2006/48/ec financial institutions are not subject to the rules applicable to credit institutions they should be made subject to the same requirements as payment institutions so that they are able to provide payment services throughout the community directive 2006/48/ec should therefore be amended accordingly 58 since money remittance is defined in this directive as a payment service which requires an authorisation for a payment institution or a registration for some natural or legal persons benefiting from a waiver clause under certain circumstances specified in the provisions of this directive directive 2005/60/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 26 october 2005 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing 22 should be amended accordingly 59 in the interests of legal certainty it is appropriate to make transitional arrangements in accordance with which persons who have commenced the activities of payment institutions in accordance with the national law in force before the entry into force of this directive may continue those activities within the member state concerned for a specified period 60 since the objective of this directive namely the establishment of a single market in payment services can not be sufficiently achieved by the member states because it requires the harmonisation of a multitude of different rules currently existing in the legal systems of the various member states and can therefore be better achieved at community level the community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in article 5 of the treaty in accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that article this directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective 61 the measures necessary for the implementation of this directive should be adopted in accordance with council decision 1999/468/ec of 28 june 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the commission 23 62 in particular the commission should be empowered to adopt implementing provisions in order to take account of technological and market developments since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this directive they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in article 5a of decision 1999/468/ec 63 in accordance with point 34 of the interinstitutional agreement on better law-making 24

32012R0648	l_2012201en.01000101.xml 27.7.2012 en official journal of the european union l 201/1 regulation eu no 648/2012 of the european parliament and of the council of 4 july 2012 on otc derivatives central counterparties and trade repositories text with eea relevance the european parliament and the council of the european union having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the european union and in particular article 114 thereof having regard to the proposal from the european commission after transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments having regard to the opinion of the european central bank 1 having regard to the opinion of the european economic and social committee 2 acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 3 whereas 1 at the request of the commission a report was published on 25 february 2009 by a high-level group chaired by jacques de larosière and concluded that the supervisory framework of the financial sector of the union needed to be strengthened to reduce the risk and severity of future financial crises and recommended far-reaching reforms to the structure of supervision of that sector including the creation of a european system of financial supervisors comprising three european supervisory authorities one each for the banking the insurance and occupational pensions and the securities and markets sectors and the creation of a european systemic risk council 2 the commission communication of 4 march 2009 entitled ‘ driving european recovery ’ proposed to strengthen the union ’ s regulatory framework for financial services in its communication of 3 july 2009 entitled ‘ ensuring efficient safe and sound derivatives markets ’ the commission assessed the role of derivatives in the financial crisis and in its communication of 20 october 2009 entitled ‘ ensuring efficient safe and sound derivative markets future policy actions ’ the commission outlined the actions it intends to take to reduce the risks associated with derivatives 3 on 23 september 2009 the commission adopted proposals for three regulations establishing the european system of financial supervision including the creation of three european supervisory authorities esas to contribute to a consistent application of union legislation and to the establishment of high-quality common regulatory and supervisory standards and practices the esas comprise the european supervisory authority european banking authority eba established by regulation eu no 1093/2010 of the european parliament and of the council 4 the european supervisory authority european insurance and occupational pensions authority eiopa established by regulation eu no 1094/2010 of the european parliament and of the council 5 and the european supervisory authority european securities and markets authority esma established by regulation eu no 1095/2010 of the european parliament and of the council 6 the esas have a crucial role to play in safeguarding the stability of the financial sector it is therefore essential to ensure continuously that the development of their work is a matter of high political priority and that they are adequately resourced 4 over-the-counter derivatives ‘ otc derivative contracts ’ lack transparency as they are privately negotiated contracts and any information concerning them is usually only available to the contracting parties they create a complex web of interdependence which can make it difficult to identify the nature and level of risks involved the financial crisis has demonstrated that such characteristics increase uncertainty in times of market stress and accordingly pose risks to financial stability this regulation lays down conditions for mitigating those risks and improving the transparency of derivative contracts 5 at the 26 september 2009 summit in pittsburgh g20 leaders agreed that all standardised otc derivative contracts should be cleared through a central counterparty ccp by the end of 2012 and that otc derivative contracts should be reported to trade repositories in june 2010 g20 leaders in toronto reaffirmed their commitment and also committed to accelerate the implementation of strong measures to improve transparency and regulatory oversight of otc derivative contracts in an internationally consistent and non-discriminatory way 6 the commission will monitor and endeavour to ensure that those commitments are implemented in a similar way by the union ’ s international partners the commission should cooperate with third-country authorities in order to explore mutually supportive solutions to ensure consistency between this regulation and the requirements established by third countries and thus avoid any possible overlapping in this respect with the assistance of esma the commission should monitor and prepare reports to the european parliament and the council on the international application of principles laid down in this regulation in order to avoid potential duplicate or conflicting requirements the commission might adopt decisions on equivalence of the legal supervisory and enforcement framework in third countries if a number of conditions are met the assessment which forms the basis of such decisions should not prejudice the right of a ccp established in a third country and recognised by esma to provide clearing services to clearing members or trading venues established in the union as the recognition decision should be independent of this assessment similarly neither an equivalence decision nor the assessment should prejudice the right of a trade repository established in a third country and recognised by esma to provide services to entities established in the union 7 with regard to the recognition of third-country ccps and in accordance with the union ’ s international obligations under the agreement establishing the world trade organisation including the general agreement on trade in services decisions determining third-country legal regimes as equivalent to the legal regime of the union should be adopted only if the legal regime of the third country provides for an effective equivalent system for the recognition of ccps authorised under foreign legal regimes in accordance with the general regulatory goals and standards set out by the g20 in september 2009 of improving transparency in the derivatives markets mitigating systemic risk and protecting against market abuse such a system should be considered equivalent if it ensures that the substantial result of the applicable regulatory regime is similar to union requirements and should be considered effective if those rules are being applied in a consistent manner 8 it is appropriate and necessary in this context taking account of the characteristics of derivative markets and the functioning of ccps to verify the effective equivalence of foreign regulatory systems in meeting g20 goals and standards in order to improve transparency in derivatives markets mitigate systemic risk and protect against market abuse the very special situation of ccps requires that the provisions relating to third countries are organised and function in accordance with arrangements that are specific to these market structure entities therefore this approach does not constitute a precedent for other legislation 9 the european council in its conclusions of 2 december 2009 agreed that there was a need to substantially improve the mitigation of counterparty credit risk and that it was important to improve transparency efficiency and integrity for derivative transactions the european parliament resolution of 15 june 2010 on ‘ derivatives markets future policy actions ’ called for mandatory clearing and reporting of otc derivative contracts 10 esma should act within the scope of this regulation by safeguarding the stability of financial markets in emergency situations ensuring the consistent application of union rules by national supervisory authorities and settling disagreements between them it is also entrusted with developing draft regulatory and implementing technical standards and has a central role in the authorisation and monitoring of ccps and trade repositories 11 one of the basic tasks to be carried out through the european system of central banks escb is to promote the smooth operation of payment systems in this respect the members of the escb execute oversight by ensuring efficient and sound clearing and payment systems including ccps the members of the escb are thus closely involved in the authorisation and monitoring of ccps recognition of third-country ccps and the approval of interoperability arrangements in addition they are closely involved in respect of the setting of regulatory technical standards as well as guidelines and recommendations this regulation is without prejudice to the responsibilities of the european central bank ecb and the national central banks ncbs to ensure efficient and sound clearing and payment systems within the union and with other countries consequently and in order to prevent the possible creation of parallel sets of rules esma and the escb should cooperate closely when preparing the relevant draft technical standards further the access to information by the ecb and the ncbs is crucial when fulfilling their tasks relating to the oversight of clearing and payment systems as well as to the functions of a central bank of issue 12 uniform rules are required for derivative contracts set out in annex i section c points 4 to 10 of directive 2004/39/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 21 april 2004 on markets in financial instruments 7 13 incentives to promote the use of ccps have not proven to be sufficient to ensure that standardised otc derivative contracts are in fact cleared centrally mandatory ccp clearing requirements for those otc derivative contracts that can be cleared centrally are therefore necessary 14 it is likely that member states will adopt divergent national measures which could create obstacles to the smooth functioning of the internal market and be to the detriment of market participants and financial stability a uniform application of the clearing obligation in the union is also necessary to ensure a high level of investor protection and to create a level playing field between market participants 15 ensuring that the clearing obligation reduces systemic risk requires a process of identification of classes of derivatives that should be subject to that obligation that process should take into account the fact that not all ccp-cleared otc derivative contracts can be considered suitable for mandatory ccp clearing 16 this regulation sets out the criteria for determining whether or not different classes of otc derivative contracts should be subject to a clearing obligation on the basis of draft regulatory technical standards developed by esma the commission should decide whether a class of otc derivative contract is to be subject to a clearing obligation and from when the clearing obligation takes effect including where appropriate phased-in implementation and the minimum remaining maturity of contracts entered into or novated before the date on which the clearing obligation takes effect in accordance with this regulation a phased-in implementation of the clearing obligation could be in terms of the types of market participants that must comply with the clearing obligation in determining which classes of otc derivative contracts are to be subject to the clearing obligation esma should take into account the specific nature of otc derivative contracts which are concluded with covered bond issuers or with cover pools for covered bonds 17 when determining which classes of otc derivative contracts are to be subject to the clearing obligation esma should also pay due regard to other relevant considerations most importantly the interconnectedness between counterparties using the relevant classes of otc derivative contracts and the impact on the levels of counterparty credit risk as well as promote equal conditions of competition within the internal market as referred to in article 1 5 d of regulation eu no 1095/2010 18 where esma has identified that an otc derivative product is standardised and suitable for clearing but no ccp is willing to clear that product esma should investigate the reason for this 19 in determining which classes of otc derivative contracts are to be subject to the clearing obligation due account should be taken of the specific nature of the relevant classes of otc derivative contracts the predominant risk for transactions in some classes of otc derivative contracts may relate to settlement risk which is addressed through separate infrastructure arrangements and may distinguish certain classes of otc derivative contracts such as foreign exchange from other classes ccp clearing specifically addresses counterparty credit risk and may not be the optimal solution for dealing with settlement risk the regime for such contracts should rely in particular on preliminary international convergence and mutual recognition of the relevant infrastructure 20 in order to ensure a uniform and coherent application of this regulation and a level playing field for market participants when a class of otc derivative contract is declared subject to the clearing obligation this obligation should also apply to all contracts pertaining to that class of otc derivative contract entered into on or after the date of notification of a ccp authorisation for the purpose of the clearing obligation received by esma but before the date from which the clearing obligation takes effect provided that those contracts have a remaining maturity above the minimum determined by the commission 21 in determining whether a class of otc derivative contract is to be subject to clearing requirements esma should aim for a reduction in systemic risk this includes taking into account in the assessment factors such as the level of contractual and operational standardisation of contracts the volume and the liquidity of the relevant class of otc derivative contract as well as the availability of fair reliable and generally accepted pricing information in the relevant class of otc derivative contract 22 for an otc derivative contract to be cleared both parties to that contract must be subject to a clearing obligation or must consent exemptions to the clearing obligation should be narrowly tailored as they would reduce the effectiveness of the obligation and the benefits of ccp clearing and may lead to regulatory arbitrage between groups of market participants 23 in order to foster financial stability within the union it might be necessary also to subject the transactions entered into by entities established in third countries to the clearing and risk-mitigation techniques obligations provided that the transactions concerned have a direct substantial and foreseeable effect within the union or where such obligations are necessary or appropriate to prevent the evasion of any provisions of this regulation 24 otc derivative contracts that are not considered suitable for ccp clearing entail counterparty credit and operational risk and therefore rules should be established to manage that risk to mitigate counterparty credit risk market participants that are subject to the clearing obligation should have risk-management procedures that require the timely accurate and appropriately segregated exchange of collateral when preparing draft regulatory technical standards specifying those risk-management procedures esma should take into account the proposals of the international standard setting bodies on margining requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives when developing draft regulatory technical standards to specify the arrangements required for the accurate and appropriate exchange of collateral to manage risks associated with uncleared trades esma should take due account of impediments faced by covered bond issuers or cover pools in providing collateral in a number of union jurisdictions esma should also take into account the fact that preferential claims given to covered bond issuers counterparties on the covered bond issuer ’ s assets provides equivalent protection against counterparty credit risk 25 rules on clearing otc derivative contracts reporting on derivative transactions and risk-mitigation techniques for otc derivative contracts not cleared by a ccp should apply to financial counterparties namely investment firms as authorised in accordance with directive 2004/39/ec credit institutions as authorised in accordance with directive 2006/48/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 14 june 2006 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions 8 insurance undertakings as authorised in accordance with first council directive 73/239/eec of 24 july 1973 on the coordination of laws regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking-up and pursuit of the business of direct insurance other than life insurance 9 assurance undertakings as authorised in accordance with directive 2002/83/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 5 november 2002 concerning life assurance 10 reinsurance undertakings as authorised in accordance with directive 2005/68/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 16 november 2005 on reinsurance 11 undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities ucits and where relevant their management companies as authorised in accordance with directive 2009/65/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 13 july 2009 on the coordination of laws regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities ucits 12 institutions for occupational retirement provision as defined in directive 2003/41/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 3 june 2003 on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision 13 and alternative investment funds managed by alternative investment fund managers aifm as authorised or registered in accordance with directive 2011/61/eu of the european parliament and of the council of 8 june 2011 on alternative investment fund managers 14 26 entities operating pension scheme arrangements the primary purpose of which is to provide benefits upon retirement usually in the form of payments for life but also as payments made for a temporary period or as a lump sum typically minimise their allocation to cash in order to maximise the efficiency and the return for their policy holders hence requiring such entities to clear otc derivative contracts centrally would lead to divesting a significant proportion of their assets for cash in order for them to meet the ongoing margin requirements of ccps to avoid a likely negative impact of such a requirement on the retirement income of future pensioners the clearing obligation should not apply to pension schemes until a suitable technical solution for the transfer of non-cash collateral as variation margins is developed by ccps to address this problem such a technical solution should take into account the special role of pension scheme arrangements and avoid materially adverse effects on pensioners during a transitional period otc derivative contracts entered into with a view to decreasing investment risks directly relating to the financial solvency of pension scheme arrangements should be subject not only to the reporting obligation but also to bilateral collateralisation requirements the ultimate aim however is central clearing as soon as this is tenable 27 it is important to ensure that only appropriate entities and arrangements receive special treatment as well as to take into account the diversity of pension systems across the union while also to provide for a level playing field for all pension scheme arrangements therefore the temporary derogation should apply to institutions for occupational retirement provision registered in accordance with directive 2003/41/ec including any authorised entity responsible for managing such an institution and acting on its behalf as referred to in article 2 1 of that directive as well as any legal entity set up for the purpose of investment by such institutions acting solely and exclusively in their interest and to occupational retirement provision businesses of institutions referred to in article 3 of directive 2003/41/ec 28 the temporary derogation should also apply to occupational retirement provision businesses of life insurance undertakings provided that all corresponding assets and liabilities are ring-fenced managed and organised separately without any possibility of transfer it should also apply to any other authorised and supervised entities operating on a national basis only or arrangements that are provided mainly in the territory of one member state only if both of them are recognised by national law and their primary purpose is to provide benefits upon retirement the entities and arrangements referred to in this recital should be subject to the decision of the relevant competent authority and in order to ensure consistency remove possible misalignments and avoid any abuse the opinion of esma after consulting eiopa this could include entities and arrangements that are not necessarily linked to an employer pension programme but still have the primary purpose of providing income at retirement either on a compulsory or on a voluntary basis examples could include legal entities operating pension schemes on a funded basis under national law provided that they invest in accordance with the ‘ prudent person ’ principle and pension arrangements taken up by individuals directly which may also be provided by life insurers the exemption in the case of pension arrangements taken up by individuals directly should not cover otc derivative contracts relating to other life insurance products of the insurer which do not have the primary purpose of providing an income at retirement further examples might be retirement provision businesses of insurance undertakings covered by directive 2002/83/ec provided that all assets corresponding to the businesses are included in a special register in accordance with the annex to directive 2001/17/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 19 march 2001 on the reorganisation and winding-up of insurance undertakings 15 as well as occupational retirement provision arrangements of insurance undertakings based on collective bargaining agreements institutions established for the purpose of providing compensation to members of pension scheme arrangements in the case of a default should also be treated as a pension scheme for the purpose of this regulation 29 where appropriate rules applicable to financial counterparties should also apply to non-financial counterparties it is recognised that non-financial counterparties use otc derivative contracts in order to cover themselves against commercial risks directly linked to their commercial or treasury financing activities consequently in determining whether a non-financial counterparty should be subject to the clearing obligation consideration should be given to the purpose for which that non-financial counterparty uses otc derivative contracts and to the size of the exposures that it has in those instruments in order to ensure that non-financial institutions have the opportunity to state their views on the clearing thresholds esma should when preparing the relevant regulatory technical standards conduct an open public consultation ensuring the participation of non-financial institutions esma should also consult all relevant authorities for example the agency for the cooperation of energy regulators in order to ensure that the particularities of those sectors are fully taken into account moreover by 17 august 2015 the commission should assess the systemic importance of the transactions of non-financial firms in otc derivative contracts in different sectors including in the energy sector 30 in determining whether an otc derivative contract reduces risks directly relating to the commercial activities and treasury activities of a non-financial counterparty due account should be taken of that non-financial counterparty ’ s overall hedging and risk-mitigation strategies in particular consideration should be given to whether an otc derivative contract is economically appropriate for the reduction of risks in the conduct and management of a non-financial counterparty where the risks relate to fluctuations in interest rates foreign exchange rates inflation rates or commodity prices 31 the clearing threshold is a very important figure for all non-financial counterparties when the clearing threshold is set the systemic relevance of the sum of net positions and exposures per counterparty and per class of otc derivative contract should be taken into account in that connection appropriate efforts should be made to recognise the methods of risk mitigation used by non-financial counterparties in the context of their normal business activity 32 members of the escb and other member states ’ bodies performing similar functions other union public bodies charged with or intervening in the management of the public debt and the bank for international settlements should be excluded from the scope of this regulation in order to avoid limiting their power to perform their tasks of common interest 33 as not all market participants that are subject to the clearing obligation are able to become clearing members of the ccp they should have the possibility to access ccps as clients or indirect clients subject to certain conditions 34 the introduction of a clearing obligation along with a process to establish which ccps can be used for the purpose of this obligation may lead to unintended competitive distortions of the otc derivatives market for example a ccp could refuse to clear transactions executed on certain trading venues because the ccp is owned by a competing trading venue in order to avoid such discriminatory practices ccps should agree to clear transactions executed in different trading venues to the extent that those trading venues comply with the operational and technical requirements established by the ccp without reference to the contractual documents on the basis of which the parties concluded the relevant otc derivative transaction provided that those documents are consistent with market standards trading venues should provide the ccps with trade feeds on a transparent and non-discriminatory basis the right of access of a ccp to a trading venue should allow for arrangements whereby multiple ccps use trade feeds of the same trading venue however this should not lead to interoperability for derivatives clearing or create liquidity fragmentation 35 this regulation should not block fair and open access between trading venues and ccps in the internal market subject to the conditions laid down in this regulation and in the regulatory technical standards developed by esma and adopted by the commission the commission should continue to monitor closely the evolution of the otc derivatives market and should where necessary intervene in order to prevent competitive distortions from occurring in the internal market with the aim of ensuring a level playing field in the financial markets 36 in certain areas within financial services and trading of derivative contracts commercial and intellectual property rights may also exist in instances where such property rights relate to products or services which have become or impact upon industry standards licences should be available on proportionate fair reasonable and non-discriminatory terms 37 in order to identify the relevant classes of otc derivative contracts that should be subject to the clearing obligation the thresholds and systemically relevant non-financial counterparties reliable data is needed therefore for regulatory purposes it is important that a uniform derivatives data reporting requirement is established at union level moreover a retrospective reporting obligation is needed to the largest possible extent for both financial counterparties and non-financial counterparties in order to provide comparative data including to esma and the relevant competent authorities 38 an intragroup transaction is a transaction between two undertakings which are included in the same consolidation on a full basis and are subject to appropriate centralised risk evaluation measurement and control procedures they are part of the same institutional protection scheme as referred to in article 80 8 of directive 2006/48/ec or in the case of credit institutions affiliated to the same central body as referred to in article 3 1 of that directive both are credit institutions or one is a credit institution and the other is a central body otc derivative contracts may be recognised within non-financial or financial groups as well as within groups composed of both financial and non-financial undertakings and if such a contract is considered an intragroup transaction in respect of one counterparty then it should also be considered an intragroup transaction in respect of the other counterparty to that contract it is recognised that intragroup transactions may be necessary for aggregating risks within a group structure and that intragroup risks are therefore specific since the submission of those transactions to the clearing obligation may limit the efficiency of those intragroup risk-management processes an exemption of intragroup transactions from the clearing obligation may be beneficial provided that this exemption does not increase systemic risk as a result adequate exchange of collateral should be substituted to the ccp clearing those transactions where that is appropriate to mitigate intragroup counterparty risks 39 however some intragroup transactions could be exempted in some cases on the basis of the decision of the competent authorities from the collateralisation requirement provided that their risk-management procedures are adequately sound robust and consistent with the level of complexity of the transaction and there is no impediment to the prompt transfer of own funds or repayment of liabilities between the counterparties those criteria as well as the procedures for the counterparties and the relevant competent authorities to be followed while applying exemptions should be specified in regulatory technical standards adopted in accordance with the relevant regulations establishing the esas before developing such draft regulatory technical standards the esas should prepare an impact assessment of their potential impact on the internal market as well as on financial market participants and in particular on the operations and the structure of groups concerned all the technical standards applicable to the collateral exchanged in intragroup transactions including criteria for the exemption should take into account the prevailing specificities of those transactions and existing differences between non-financial and financial counterparties as well as their purpose and methods of using derivatives 40 counterparties should be considered to be included in the same consolidation at least where they are both included in a consolidation in accordance with council directive 83/349/eec 16 or international financial reporting standards ifrs adopted pursuant to regulation ec no 1606/2002 of the european parliament and of the council 17 or in relation to a group the parent undertaking of which has its head office in a third country in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of a third country determined to be equivalent to ifrs in accordance with commission regulation ec no 1569/2007 18 or accounting standards of a third country the use of which is permitted in accordance with article 4 of regulation ec no 1569/2007 or where they are both covered by the same consolidated supervision in accordance with directive 2006/48/ec or with directive 2006/49/ec of the european parliament and of the council 19 or in relation to a group the parent undertaking of which has its head office in a third country the same consolidated supervision by a third country competent authority verified as equivalent to that governed by the principles laid down in article 143 of directive 2006/48/ec or in article 2 of directive 2006/49/ec 41 it is important that market participants report all details regarding derivative contracts they have entered into to trade repositories as a result information on the risks inherent in derivatives markets will be centrally stored and easily accessible inter alia to esma the relevant competent authorities the european systemic risk board esrb and the relevant central banks of the escb 42 the provision of trade repository services is characterised by economies of scale which may hamper competition in this particular field at the same time the imposition of a comprehensive reporting requirement on market participants may increase the value of the information maintained by trade repositories also for third parties providing ancillary services such as trade confirmation trade matching credit event servicing portfolio reconciliation or portfolio compression it is appropriate to ensure that a level playing field in the post-trade sector more generally is not compromised by a possible natural monopoly in the provision of trade repository services therefore trade repositories should be required to provide access to the information held in the repository on fair reasonable and non-discriminatory terms subject to necessary precautions on data protection 43 in order to allow for a comprehensive overview of the market and for assessing systemic risk both ccp-cleared and non-ccp-cleared derivative contracts should be reported to trade repositories 44 the esas should be provided with adequate resources in order to perform the tasks they are given in this regulation effectively 45 counterparties and ccps that conclude modify or terminate a derivative contract should ensure that the details of that contract are reported to a trade repository they should be able to delegate the reporting of the contract to another entity an entity or its employees that report the details of a derivative contract to a trade repository on behalf of a counterparty in accordance with this regulation should not be in breach of any restriction on disclosure when preparing the draft regulatory technical standards regarding reporting esma should take into account the progress made in the development of a unique contract identifier and the list of required reporting data in annex i table 1 of commission regulation ec no 1287/2006 20 implementing directive 2004/39/ec and consult other relevant authorities such as the agency for the cooperation of energy regulators 46 taking into consideration the principles set out in the commission ’ s communication on reinforcing sanctioning regimes in the financial services sector and legal acts of the union adopted as a follow-up to that communication member states should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this regulation member states should enforce those penalties in a manner that does not reduce the effectiveness of those rules those penalties should be effective proportionate and dissuasive they should be based on guidelines adopted by esma to promote convergence and cross-sector consistency of penalty regimes in the financial sector member states should ensure that the penalties imposed are publicly disclosed where appropriate and that assessment reports on the effectiveness of existing rules are published at regular intervals 47 a ccp might be established in accordance with this regulation in any member state no member state or group of member states should be discriminated against directly or indirectly as a venue for clearing services nothing in this regulation should attempt to restrict or impede a ccp in one jurisdiction from clearing a product denominated in the currency of another member state or in the currency of a third country 48 authorisation of a ccp should be conditional on a minimum amount of initial capital capital including retained earnings and reserves of a ccp should be proportionate to the risk stemming from the activities of the ccp at all times in order to ensure that it is adequately capitalised against credit counterparty market operational legal and business risks which are not already covered by specific financial resources and that it is able to conduct an orderly winding-up or restructuring of its operations if necessary 49 as this regulation introduces a legal obligation to clear through specific ccps for regulatory purposes it is essential to ensure that those ccps are safe and sound and comply at all times with the stringent organisational business conduct and prudential requirements established by this regulation in order to ensure uniform application of this regulation those requirements should apply to the clearing of all financial instruments in which the ccps deal 50 it is therefore necessary for regulatory and harmonisation purposes to ensure that counterparties only use ccps which comply with the requirements laid down in this regulation those requirements should not prevent member states from adopting or continuing to apply additional requirements in respect of ccps established in their territory including certain authorisation requirements under directive 2006/48/ec however imposing such additional requirements should not influence the right of ccps authorised in other member states or recognised in accordance with this regulation to provide clearing services to clearing members and their clients established in the member state introducing additional requirements since those ccps are not subject to those additional requirements and do not need to comply with them by 30 september 2014 esma should draft a report on the impact of the application of additional requirements by member states 51 direct rules regarding the authorisation and supervision of ccps are an essential corollary to the obligation to clear otc derivative contracts it is appropriate that competent authorities retain responsibility for all aspects of the authorisation and the supervision of ccps including the responsibility for verifying that the applicant ccp complies with this regulation and with directive 98/26/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 19 may 1998 on settlement finality in payment and securities settlement systems 21 in view of the fact that those national competent authorities remain best placed to examine how the ccps operate on a daily basis to carry out regular reviews and to take appropriate action where necessary 52 where a ccp risks insolvency fiscal responsibility may lie predominantly with the member state in which that ccp is established it follows that authorisation and supervision of that ccp should be exercised by the relevant competent authority of that member state however since a ccp ’ s clearing members may be established in different member states and they will be the first to be impacted by the ccp ’ s default it is imperative that all relevant competent authorities and esma be involved in the authorisation and supervisory process this will avoid divergent national measures or practices and obstacles to the proper functioning of the internal market furthermore no proposal or policy of any member of a college of supervisors should directly or indirectly discriminate against any member state or group of member states as a venue for clearing services in any currency esma should be a participant in every college in order to ensure the consistent and correct application of this regulation esma should involve other competent authorities in the member states concerned in the work of preparing recommendations and decisions 53 in light of the role assigned to colleges it is important that all the relevant competent authorities as well as members of the escb are involved in performing their tasks the college should consist not only of the competent authorities supervising the ccp but also of the supervisors of the entities on which the operations of that ccp might have an impact namely selected clearing members trading venues interoperable ccps and central securities depositories members of the escb that are responsible for the oversight of the ccp and interoperable ccps as well as those responsible for the issue of the currencies of the financial instruments cleared by the ccp should be able to participate in the college as the supervised or overseen entities would be established in a limited range of member states in which the ccp operates a single competent authority or member of the escb could be responsible for supervision or oversight of a number of those entities in order to ensure smooth cooperation between all the members of the college appropriate procedures and mechanisms should be put in place 54 since the establishment and functioning of the college is assumed to be based on a written agreement between all of its members it is appropriate to confer upon them the power to determine the college ’ s decision-making procedures given the sensitivity of the issue therefore detailed rules on voting procedures should be laid down in a written agreement between the members of the college however in order to balance the interests of all the relevant market participants and member states appropriately the college should vote in accordance with the general principle whereby each member has one vote irrespective of the number of functions it performs in accordance with this regulation for colleges with up to and including 12 members a maximum of two college members belonging to the same member state should have a vote and each voting member should have one vote for colleges with more than 12 members a maximum of three college members belonging to the same member state should have a vote and each voting member should have one vote 55 the very particular situation of ccps requires that colleges are organised and function in accordance with arrangements that are specific to the supervision of ccps 56 the arrangements provided for in this regulation do not constitute a precedent for other legislation on the supervision and oversight of financial market infrastructures in particular with regard to the voting modalities for referrals to esma 57 a ccp should not be authorised where all the members of the college excluding the competent authorities of the member state where the ccp is established reach a joint opinion by mutual agreement that the ccp should not be authorised if however a sufficient majority of the college has expressed a negative opinion and any of the competent authorities concerned based on that majority of two-thirds of the college has referred the matter to esma the competent authority of the member state where the ccp is established should defer its decision on the authorisation and await any decision that esma may take regarding conformity with union law the competent authority of the member state where the ccp is established should take its decision in accordance with such a decision by esma where all the members of the college excluding the authorities of the member state where the ccp is established reach a joint opinion to the effect that they consider that the requirements are not met and that the ccp should not receive authorisation the competent authority of the member state where the ccp is established should be able to refer the matter to esma to decide on conformity with union law 58 it is necessary to reinforce provisions on exchange of information between competent authorities esma and other relevant authorities and to strengthen the duties of assistance and cooperation between them due to increasing cross-border activity those authorities should provide each other with the relevant information for the exercise of their functions so as to ensure the effective enforcement of this regulation including in situations where infringements or suspected infringements may be of concern to authorities in two or more member states for the exchange of information strict professional secrecy is needed it is essential due to the wide impact of otc derivative contracts that other relevant authorities such as tax authorities and energy regulators have access to information necessary to the exercise of their functions 59 in view of the global nature of financial markets esma should be directly responsible for recognising ccps established in third countries and thus allowing them to provide clearing services within the union provided that the commission has recognised the legal and supervisory framework of that third country as equivalent to the union framework and that certain other conditions are met therefore a ccp established in a third country providing clearing services to clearing members or trading venues established in the union should be recognised by esma however in order not to hamper the further development of cross-border investment management business in the union a third-country ccp providing services to clients established in the union through a clearing member established in a third country should not have to be recognised by esma in this context agreements with the union ’ s major international partners will be of particular importance in order to ensure a global level playing field and financial stability 60 on 16 september 2010 the european council agreed on the need for the union to promote its interest and values more assertively and in a spirit of reciprocity and mutual benefit in the context of the union ’ s external relations and to take steps inter alia to secure greater market access for european business and deepen regulatory cooperation with major trade partners 61 a ccp should have robust governance arrangements senior management of good repute and independent members on its board irrespective of its ownership structure at least one-third and no less than two members of its board should be independent however different governance arrangements and ownership structures may influence a ccp ’ s willingness or ability to clear certain products it is thus appropriate that the independent members of the board and the risk committee to be established by the ccp address any potential conflict of interests within a ccp clearing members and clients need to be adequately represented as decisions taken by the ccp may have an impact on them 62 a ccp may outsource functions the ccp ’ s risk committee should advise on such outsourcing major activities linked to risk management should not be outsourced unless this is approved by the competent authority 63 the participation requirements for a ccp should be transparent proportionate and non-discriminatory and should allow for remote access to the extent that this does not expose the ccp to additional risks 64 clients of clearing members that clear their otc derivative contracts with ccps should be granted a high level of protection the actual level of protection depends on the level of segregation that those clients choose intermediaries should segregate their assets from those of their clients for this reason ccps should keep updated and easily identifiable records in order to facilitate the transfer of the positions and assets of a defaulting clearing member ’ s clients to a solvent clearing member or as the case may be the orderly liquidation of the clients ’ positions and the return of excess collateral to the clients the requirements laid down in this regulation on the segregation and portability of clients ’ positions and assets should therefore prevail over any conflicting laws regulations and administrative provisions of the member states that prevent the parties from fulfilling them 65 a ccp should have a sound risk-management framework to manage credit risks liquidity risks operational and other risks including the risks that it bears or poses to other entities as a result of interdependencies a ccp should have adequate procedures and mechanisms in place to deal with the default of a clearing member in order to minimise the contagion risk of such a default the ccp should have in place stringent participation requirements collect appropriate initial margins maintain a default fund and other financial resources to cover potential losses in order to ensure that it benefits from sufficient resources on an ongoing basis the ccp should establish a minimum amount below which the size of the default fund is not generally to fall this should not however limit the ccp ’ s ability to use the entirety of the default fund to cover the losses caused by a clearing member ’ s default 66 when defining a sound risk-management framework a ccp should take into account its potential risk and economic impact on the clearing members and their clients although the development of a highly robust risk management should remain its primary objective a ccp may adapt its features to the specific activities and risk profiles of the clients of the clearing members and if deemed appropriate on the basis of the criteria specified in the regulatory technical standards to be developed by esma may include in the scope of the highly liquid assets accepted as collateral at least cash government bonds covered bonds in accordance with directive 2006/48/ec subject to adequate haircuts guarantees callable on first demand granted by a member of the escb commercial bank guarantees under strict conditions in particular relating to the creditworthiness of the guarantor and the guarantor ’ s capital links with ccp ’ s clearing members where appropriate esma may also consider gold as an asset acceptable as collateral ccps should be able to accept under strict risk-management conditions commercial bank guarantees from non-financial counterparties acting as clearing members 67 ccps ’ risk-management strategies should be sufficiently sound so as to avoid risks for the taxpayer 68 margin calls and haircuts on collateral may have procyclical effects ccps competent authorities and esma should therefore adopt measures to prevent and control possible procyclical effects in risk-management practices adopted by ccps to the extent that a ccp ’ s soundness and financial security is not negatively affected 69 exposure management is an essential part of the clearing process access to and use of the relevant pricing sources should be granted to provide clearing services in general such pricing sources should include those relating to indices that are used as references to derivatives or other financial instruments 70 margins are the primary line of defence for a ccp although ccps should invest the margins received in a safe and prudent manner they should make particular efforts to ensure adequate protection of margins to guarantee that they are returned in a timely manner to the non-defaulting clearing members or to an interoperable ccp where the ccp collecting these margins defaults 71 access to adequate liquidity resources is essential for a ccp it is possible for such liquidity to derive from access to central bank liquidity creditworthy and reliable commercial bank liquidity or a combination of both access to liquidity could result from an authorisation granted in accordance with article 6 of directive 2006/48/ec or other appropriate arrangements in assessing the adequacy of liquidity resources especially in stress situations a ccp should take into consideration the risks of obtaining the liquidity by only relying on commercial banks credit lines 72 the ‘ european code of conduct for clearing and settlement ’ of 7 november 2006 established a voluntary framework for establishing links between ccps however the post-trade sector remains fragmented along national lines making cross-border trades more costly and hindering harmonisation it is therefore necessary to lay down the conditions for the establishment of interoperability arrangements between ccps to the extent these do not expose the relevant ccps to risks that are not appropriately managed 73 interoperability arrangements are important for greater integration of the post-trading market within the union and regulation should be provided for however as interoperability arrangements may expose ccps to additional risks ccps should have been for three years authorised to clear or recognised in accordance with this regulation or authorised under a pre-existing national authorisation regime before competent authorities grant approval of such interoperability arrangements in addition given the additional complexities involved in an interoperability arrangement between ccps clearing otc derivative contracts it is appropriate at this stage to restrict the scope of interoperability arrangements to transferable securities and money-market instruments however by 30 september 2014 esma should submit a report to the commission on whether an extension of that scope to other financial instruments would be appropriate 74 trade repositories collect data for regulatory purposes that are relevant to authorities in all member states esma should assume responsibility for the registration withdrawal of registration and supervision of trade repositories 75 given that regulators ccps and other market participants rely on the data maintained by trade repositories it is necessary to ensure that those trade repositories are subject to strict operational record-keeping and data-management requirements 76 transparency of prices fees and risk-management models associated with the services provided by ccps their members and trade repositories is necessary to enable market participants to make an informed choice 77 in order to carry out its duties effectively esma should be able to require by simple request or by decision all necessary information from trade repositories related third parties and third parties to which the trade repositories have outsourced operational functions or activities if esma requires such information by simple request the addressee is not obliged to provide the information but in the event that it does so voluntarily the information provided should not be incorrect or misleading such information should be made available without delay 78 without prejudice to cases covered by criminal or tax law the competent authorities esma bodies or natural or legal persons other than the competent authorities which receive confidential information should use it only in the performance of their duties and for the exercise of their functions however this should not prevent the exercise in accordance with national law of the functions of national bodies responsible for the prevention investigation or correction of cases of maladministration 79 in order to exercise its supervisory powers effectively esma should be able to conduct investigations and on-site inspections 80 esma should be able to delegate specific supervisory tasks to the competent authority of a member state for instance where a supervisory task requires knowledge and experience with respect to local conditions which are more easily available at national level esma should be able to delegate the carrying out of specific investigatory tasks and on-site inspections prior to the delegation of tasks esma should consult the relevant competent authority about the detailed conditions relating to such delegation of tasks including the scope of the task to be delegated the timetable for the performance of the task and the transmission of necessary information by and to esma esma should compensate the competent authorities for carrying out a delegated task in accordance with a regulation on fees to be adopted by the commission by means of a delegated act esma should not be able to delegate the power to adopt decisions on registration 81 it is necessary to ensure that competent authorities are able to request that esma examine whether the conditions for the withdrawal of a trade repository ’ s registration are met esma should assess such requests and take any appropriate measures 82 esma should be able to impose periodic penalty payments to compel trade repositories to put an end to an infringement to supply complete and correct information required by esma or to submit to an investigation or an on-site inspection 83 esma should also be able to impose fines on trade repositories where it finds that they have committed intentionally or negligently an infringement of this regulation fines should be imposed according to the level of seriousness of the infringement infringements should be divided into different groups for which specific fines should be allocated in order to calculate the fine relating to a particular infringement esma should use a two-step methodology consisting of setting a basic amount and adjusting that basic amount if necessary by certain coefficients the basic amount should be established by taking into account the annual turnover of the trade repository concerned and the adjustments should be made by increasing or decreasing the basic amount through the application of the relevant coefficients in accordance with this regulation 84 this regulation should establish coefficients linked to aggravating and mitigating circumstances in order to give the necessary tools to esma to decide on a fine which is proportionate to the seriousness of the infringement committed by a trade repository taking into account the circumstances under which that infringement has been committed 85 before taking a decision to impose fines or periodic penalty payments esma should give the persons subject to the proceedings the opportunity to be heard in order to respect their rights of defence 86 esma should refrain from imposing fines or periodic penalty payments where a prior acquittal or conviction arising from identical facts or from facts which are substantially the same has acquired the force of res judicata as a result of criminal proceedings under national law 87 esma ’ s decisions imposing fines and periodic penalty payments should be enforceable and their enforcement should be subject to the rules of civil procedure which are in force in the state in the territory of which it is carried out rules of civil procedure should not include criminal procedural rules but could include administrative procedural rules 88 in the case of an infringement committed by a trade repository esma should be empowered to take a range of supervisory measures including requiring the trade repository to bring the infringement to an end and as a last resort withdrawing the registration where the trade repository has seriously or repeatedly infringed this regulation the supervisory measures should be applied by esma taking into account the nature and seriousness of the infringement and should respect the principle of proportionality before taking a decision on supervisory measures esma should give the persons subject to the proceedings an opportunity to be heard in order to comply with their rights of defence 89 it is essential that member states and esma protect the right to privacy of natural persons when processing personal data in accordance with directive 95/46/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 24 october 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data 22 and with regulation ec no 45/2001 of the european parliament and of the council of 18 december 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the community institutions and bodies and of the free movement of such data 23 90 it is important to ensure international convergence of requirements for ccps and trade repositories this regulation follows the existing recommendations developed by the committee on payment and settlement systems cpss and international organization of securities commissions iosco noting that the cpss-iosco principles for financial market infrastructure including ccps were established on 16 april 2012. it creates a union framework in which ccps can operate safely esma should consider these existing standards and their future developments when drawing up or proposing to revise the regulatory technical standards as well as the guidelines and recommendations foreseen in this regulation 91 the power to adopt acts in accordance with article 290 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union tfeu should be delegated to the commission in respect of amendments to the list of entities exempt from this regulation further rules of procedure relating to the imposition of fines or periodic penalty payments including provisions on the rights of the defence time limits the collection of fines or periodic penalty payments and the limitation periods for the imposition and enforcement of penalty payments or fines measures to amend annex ii in order to take account of developments in the financial markets the further specification of the type of fees the matters for which fees are due the amount of the fees and the manner in which they are to be paid it is of particular importance that the commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work including at expert level the commission when preparing and drawing up delegated acts should ensure a simultaneous timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the european parliament and to the council 92 in order to ensure consistent harmonisation power should be delegated to the commission to adopt the esas ’ draft regulatory technical standards in accordance with articles 10 to 14 of regulations eu no 1093/2010 eu no 1094/2010 and eu no 1095/2010 for the application for the purposes of this regulation of points 4 to 10 of section c of annex i to directive 2004/39/ec and in order to specify the otc derivative contracts that are considered to have a direct substantial and foreseeable effect within the union or the cases where it is necessary or appropriate to prevent the evasion of any provision of this regulation the types of indirect contractual arrangements that meet the conditions set out in this regulation the classes of otc derivative contracts that should be subject to the clearing obligation the date or dates from which the clearing obligation is to take effect including any phase-in the categories of counterparties to which the clearing obligation applies and the minimum remaining maturity of the otc derivative contracts entered into or novated before the date on which the clearing obligation takes effect the details to be included in a competent authority ’ s notification to esma of its authorisation of a ccp to clear a class of otc derivative

relating to aggregate positions by class of otc derivative contract and the operational standards required in order to aggregate and compare data across repositories 93 any obligation imposed by this regulation which is to be further developed by means of delegated or implementing acts adopted under article 290 or 291 tfeu should be understood as applying only from the date on which those acts take effect 94 as a part of its development of technical guidelines and regulatory technical standards and in particular when setting the clearing threshold for non-financial counterparties under this regulation esma should organise public hearings of market participants 95 in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this regulation implementing powers should be conferred on the commission those powers should be exercised in accordance with regulation eu no 182/2011 of the european parliament and of the council of 16 february 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by member states of the commission ’ s exercise of implementing powers 24 96 the commission should monitor and assess the need for any appropriate measures to ensure the consistent and effective application and development of regulations standards and practices falling within the scope of this regulation taking into consideration the outcome of the work performed by relevant international forums 97 in view of the rules regarding interoperable systems it was deemed appropriate to amend directive 98/26/ec to protect the rights of a system operator that provides collateral security to a receiving system operator in the event of insolvency proceedings against that receiving system operator 98 in order to facilitate efficient clearing recording settlement and payment ccps and trade repositories should accommodate in their communication procedures with participants and with the market infrastructures they interface with the relevant international communication procedures and standards for messaging and reference data 99 since the objectives of this regulation namely to lay down uniform requirements for otc derivative contracts and for the performance of activities of ccps and trade repositories can not be sufficiently achieved by the member states and can therefore by reason of the scale of the action be better achieved at union level the union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in article 5 of the treaty on european union in accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that article this regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives have adopted this regulation title i subject matter scope and definitions article 1 subject

32014L0049	l_2014173en.01014901.xml 12.6.2014 en official journal of the european union l 173/149 directive 2014/49/eu of the european parliament and of the council of 16 april 2014 on deposit guarantee schemes recast text with eea relevance the european parliament and the council of the european union having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the european union and in particular article 53 1 thereof having regard to the proposal from the european commission after transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments having regard to the opinion of the european central bank 1 acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 2 whereas 1 directive 94/19/ec of the european parliament and of the council 3 has been substantially amended 4 since further amendments are to be made that directive should be recast in the interests of clarity 2 in order to make it easier to take up and pursue the business of credit institutions it is necessary to eliminate certain differences between the laws of the member states as regards the rules on deposit guarantee schemes dgss to which those credit institutions are subject 3 this directive constitutes an essential instrument for the achievement of the internal market from the point of view of both the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide financial services in the field of credit institutions while increasing the stability of the banking system and the protection of depositors in view of the costs of the failure of a credit institution to the economy as a whole and its adverse impact on financial stability and the confidence of depositors it is desirable not only to make provision for reimbursing depositors but also to allow member states sufficient flexibility to enable dgss to carry out measures to reduce the likelihood of future claims against dgss those measures should always comply with the state aid rules 4 in order to take account of the growing integration in the internal market it should be possible to merge the dgss of different member states or to create separate cross-border schemes on a voluntary basis member states should ensure sufficient stability and a balanced composition of the new and the existing dgss adverse effects on financial stability should be avoided for example where only credit institutions with a high-risk profile are transferred to a cross-border dgs 5 directive 94/19/ec requires the commission if appropriate to put forward proposals to amend that directive this directive encompasses the harmonisation of the funding mechanisms of dgss the introduction of risk-based contributions and the harmonisation of the scope of products and depositors covered 6 directive 94/19/ec is based on the principle of minimum harmonisation consequently a variety of dgss with very distinct features currently exist in the union as a result of the common requirements laid down in this directive a uniform level of protection should be provided for depositors throughout the union while ensuring the same level of stability of dgss at the same time those common requirements are of the utmost importance in order to eliminate market distortions this directive therefore contributes to the completion of the internal market 7 as a result of this directive depositors will benefit from significantly improved access to dgss thanks to a broadened and clarified scope of coverage faster repayment periods improved information and robust funding requirements this will improve consumer confidence in financial stability throughout the internal market 8 member states should ensure that their dgss have sound governance practices in place and that they produce an annual report on their activities 9 in the event of closure of an insolvent credit institution the depositors at any branches situated in a member state other than that in which the credit institution has its head office should be protected by the same dgs as the credit institution ’ s other depositors 10 this directive should not prevent member states from including within its scope credit institutions as defined in point 1 of article 4 1 of regulation eu no 575/2013 of the european parliament and of the council 5 which fall outside the scope of directive 2013/36/eu of the european parliament and of the council 6 pursuant to article 2 5 of that directive member states should be able to decide that for the purpose of this directive the central body and all credit institutions affiliated to that central body are treated as a single credit institution 11 in principle this directive requires every credit institution to join a dgs a member state admitting branches of a credit institution having its head office in a third country should decide how to apply this directive to such branches and should take account of the need to protect depositors and maintain the integrity of the financial system depositors at such branches should be fully aware of the guarantee arrangements which affect them 12 it should be recognised that there are institutional protection schemes ips which protect the credit institution itself and which in particular ensure its liquidity and solvency where such a scheme is separate from a dgs its additional safeguard role should be taken into account when determining the contributions of its members to the dgs the harmonised level of coverage provided for in this directive should not affect schemes protecting the credit institution itself unless they repay depositors 13 each credit institution should be part of a dgs recognised under this directive thereby ensuring a high level of consumer protection and a level playing field between credit institutions and preventing regulatory arbitrage a dgs should be able to provide that protection at any time 14 the key task of a dgs is to protect depositors against the consequences of the insolvency of a credit institution dgss should be able to provide that protection in various ways dgss should primarily be used to repay depositors pursuant to this directive the ‘ paybox ’ function 15 dgss should also assist in the financing of the resolution of credit institutions in accordance with directive 2014/59/eu of the european parliament and of the council 7 16 it should also be possible where permitted under national law for a dgs to go beyond a pure reimbursement function and to use the available financial means in order to prevent the failure of a credit institution with a view to avoiding the costs of reimbursing depositors and other adverse impacts those measures should however be carried out within a clearly defined framework and should in any event comply with state aid rules dgss should inter alia have appropriate systems and procedures in place for selecting and implementing such measures and monitoring affiliated risks implementing such measures should be subject to the imposition of conditions on the credit institution involving at least more stringent risk-monitoring and greater verification rights for the dgss the costs of the measures taken to prevent the failure of a credit institution should not exceed the costs of fulfilling the statutory or contractual mandates of the respective dgs with regard to protecting covered deposits at the credit institution or the institution itself 17 dgss should also be able to take the form of an ips the competent authorities should be able to recognise ips as dgss if they fulfil all criteria laid down in this directive 18 this directive should not apply to contractual schemes or ips that are not officially recognised as dgss except as regards the limited requirements on advertising and information of depositors in the case of the exclusion or withdrawal of a credit institution in any event contractual schemes and ips are subject to state aid rules 19 in the recent financial crisis uncoordinated increases in coverage across the union have in some cases led to depositors transferring money to credit institutions in countries where deposit guarantees were higher such uncoordinated increases have drained liquidity from credit institutions in times of stress in times of stability it is possible that different coverage leads to depositors choosing the highest deposit protection rather than the deposit product best suited to them it is possible that such different coverage results in competitive distortions in the internal market it is therefore necessary to ensure a harmonised level of deposit protection by all recognised dgss regardless of where the deposits are located in the union however for a limited time it should be possible to cover certain deposits relating to the personal situation of depositors at a higher level 20 the same coverage level should apply to all depositors regardless of whether a member state ’ s currency is the euro member states whose currency is not the euro should have the possibility to round off the amounts resulting from the conversion without compromising the equivalent protection of depositors 21 on the one hand the coverage level laid down in this directive should not leave too great a proportion of deposits without protection in the interests both of consumer protection and of the stability of the financial system on the other hand the cost of funding dgss should be taken into account it is therefore reasonable to set the harmonised coverage level at eur 100 000 22 this directive retains the principle of a harmonised limit per depositor rather than per deposit it is therefore appropriate to take into consideration the deposits made by depositors who are not mentioned as holders of an account or who are not the sole holders of an account the limit should be applied to each identifiable depositor the principle that the limit be applied to each identifiable depositor should not apply to collective investment undertakings subject to special protection rules which do not apply to such deposits 23 directive 2009/14/ec of the european parliament and of the council 8 introduced a fixed coverage level of eur 100 000 which has put some member states in the situation of having to lower their coverage level with risks of undermining depositor confidence while harmonisation is essential in order to secure the level playing field and financial stability in the internal market risks of undermining depositor confidence should be taken into account therefore member states should be able to apply a higher coverage level if they provided for a coverage level that was higher than the harmonised level before the application of directive 2009/14/ec such higher coverage level should be limited in time and in scope and the member states concerned should adjust the target level and contributions paid to their dgss proportionately given that it is not possible to adjust the target level if the coverage level is unlimited it is appropriate to limit the option to member states which on 1 january 2008 applied a coverage level within a range of between eur 100 000 and eur 300 000. in order to limit the impact of diverging coverage levels and taking into account that the commission will review the implementation of this directive by 31 december 2018 it is appropriate to allow for this option until that date 24 dgss should be permitted to set off liabilities of a depositor against that depositor ’ s claims for repayment only if those liabilities are due on or before the date of unavailability such set off should not impede the capacity of dgss to repay deposits within the deadline set by this directive member states should not be prevented from taking appropriate measures concerning the rights of dgss in a winding up or reorganisation procedure of a credit institution 25 it should be possible to exclude from repayment deposits where in accordance with national law the funds deposited are not at the disposal of the depositor because the depositor and the credit institution have contractually agreed that the deposit would serve only to pay off a loan contracted for the purchase of a private immovable property such deposits should be offset against the outstanding amount of the loan 26 member states should ensure that the protection of deposits resulting from certain transactions or serving certain social or other purposes is higher than eur 100 000 for a given period member states should decide on a temporary maximum coverage level for such deposits and when doing so they should take into account the significance of the protection for depositors and the living conditions in the member states in all such cases the state aid rules should be complied with 27 it is necessary to harmonise the methods of financing of dgss on the one hand the cost of financing dgss should in principle be borne by credit institutions themselves and on the other the financing capacity of dgss should be proportionate to their liabilities in order to ensure that depositors in all member states enjoy a similarly high level of protection the financing of dgss should be harmonised at a high level with a uniform ex-ante financial target level for all dgss 28 however in certain circumstances credit institutions may operate in a highly concentrated market where most credit institutions are of such a size and degree of interconnection that they would be unlikely to be wound up under normal insolvency proceedings without endangering financial stability and would therefore be more likely to be subject to orderly resolution proceedings in such circumstances schemes could be subject to a lower target level 29 electronic money and funds received in exchange for electronic money should not in accordance with directive 2009/110/ec of the european parliament and of the council 9 be treated as a deposit and should not therefore fall within the scope of this directive 30 in order to limit deposit protection to the extent necessary to ensure legal certainty and transparency for depositors and to avoid transferring investment risks to dgss financial instruments should be excluded from the scope of coverage except for existing savings products evidenced by a certificate of deposit made out to a named person 31 certain depositors should not be eligible for deposit protection in particular public authorities or other financial institutions their limited number compared to all other depositors minimises the impact on financial stability in the case of a failure of a credit institution authorities also have much easier access to credit than citizens however member states should be able to decide that the deposits of local authorities with an annual budget of up to eur 500 000 are covered non-financial undertakings should in principle be covered regardless of their size 32 depositors whose activities include money laundering within the meaning of article 1 2 or 3 of directive 2005/60/ec of the european parliament and of the council 10 should be excluded from repayment by a dgs 33 the cost to credit institutions of participating in a dgs bears no relation to the cost that would result from a massive withdrawal of deposits not only from a credit institution in difficulty but also from healthy institutions following a loss of depositor confidence in the soundness of the banking system 34 it is necessary that the available financial means of dgss amount to a certain target level and that extraordinary contributions may be collected in any event dgss should have adequate alternative funding arrangements in place to enable them to obtain short-term funding to meet claims made against them it should be possible for the available financial means of dgss to include cash deposits payment commitments and low-risk assets which can be liquidated within a short period of time the amount of contributions to the dgs should take due account of the business cycle the stability of the deposit-taking sector and existing liabilities of the dgs 35 dgss should invest in low-risk assets 36 contributions to dgss should be based on the amount of covered deposits and the degree of risk incurred by the respective member this would allow the risk profiles of individual credit institutions to be reflected including their different business models it should also lead to a fair calculation of contributions and provide incentives to operate under a less risky business model in order to tailor contributions to market circumstances and risk profiles dgss should be able to use their own risk-based methods in order to take account of particularly low-risk sectors which are regulated under national law member states should be allowed to provide for corresponding reductions in the contributions while respecting the target level for each dgs in any event calculation methods should be approved by competent authorities the european supervisory authority european banking authority ‘ eba ’ established by regulation eu no 1093/2010 of the european parliament and of the council 11 should issue guidelines for specifying methods for calculating contributions 37 deposit protection is an essential element in the completion of the internal market and an indispensable complement to the system of supervision of credit institutions on account of the solidarity it creates among all the institutions in a given financial market in the event of the failure of any of them therefore member states should be able to allow dgss to lend money to each other on a voluntary basis 38 the existing repayment period runs counter to the need to maintain depositor confidence and does not meet depositors ’ needs the repayment period should therefore be reduced to seven working days 39 in many cases however the necessary procedures for a short time limit for repayment do not yet exist member states should therefore be given the option during a transitional period to reduce the repayment period gradually to seven working days the maximum repayment delay set out in this directive should not prevent dgss from making earlier repayments to depositors in order to ensure that during the transitional period depositors do not encounter financial difficulties in the event of failure of their credit institution depositors should however on request be able to have access to an appropriate amount of their covered deposits to cover their cost of living such access should only be made on the basis of data provided by the credit institution given the different living costs between the member states that amount should be determined by the member states 40 the period necessary for the repayment of deposits should take into account cases where schemes have difficulty in determining the amount of repayment and the rights of the depositor in particular if deposits arise from residential housing transactions or certain life events if a depositor is not absolutely entitled to the sums held on an account if the deposit is the subject of a legal dispute or competing claims to the sums held on the account or if the deposit is the subject of economic sanctions imposed by national governments or international bodies 41 in order to secure repayment dgss should be entitled to subrogate into the rights of repaid depositors against a failed credit institution member states should be able to limit the time in which depositors whose deposits were not repaid or not acknowledged within the deadline for repayment can claim repayment of their deposits in order to enable dgss to exercise the rights into which it is subrogated by the date on which those rights are due to be registered in insolvency proceedings 42 a dgs in a member state where a credit institution has established branches should inform and repay depositors on behalf of the dgs in the member state where the credit institution has been authorised safeguards are necessary to ensure that a dgs repaying depositors receives from the home dgs the necessary financial means and instructions prior to such repayment the dgs that may be concerned should enter into agreements in advance in order to facilitate those tasks 43 information is an essential element in depositor protection therefore depositors should be informed about their coverage and the responsible dgs on their statements of account intending depositors should be provided with the same information by way of a standardised information sheet receipt of which they should be asked to acknowledge the content of such information should be identical for all depositors the unregulated use in advertising of references to the coverage level and the scope of a dgs could affect the stability of the banking system or depositor confidence therefore references to dgss in advertisements should be limited to short factual statements 44 directive 95/46/ec of the european parliament and of the council 12 applies to the processing of personal data carried out pursuant to this directive dgss and relevant authorities should handle data relating to individual deposits with extreme care and should maintain a high standard of data protection in accordance with that directive 45 this directive should not result in the member states or their relevant authorities being made liable in respect of depositors if they have ensured that one or more schemes guaranteeing deposits or credit institutions themselves and ensuring the compensation or protection of depositors under the conditions prescribed in this directive have been introduced and officially recognised 46 regulation eu no 1093/2010 has assigned a number of tasks concerning directive 94/19/ec to eba 47 while respecting the supervision of dgss by member states eba should contribute to the achievement of the objective of making it easier for credit institutions to take up and pursue their activities while at the same time ensuring effective protection for depositors and minimising the risk to taxpayers member states should keep the commission and eba informed of the identity of their designated authority in view of the requirement for cooperation between eba and the designated authorities provided for in this directive 48 there is a need to introduce guidelines in financial services to ensure a level playing field and adequate protection of depositors across the union such guidelines should be issued for specifying the method for calculating risk-based contributions 49 in order to ensure efficient and effective functioning of dgss and a balanced consideration of their positions in different member states eba should be able to settle disagreements between them with binding effect 50 given the divergences in administrative practices relating to dgss in member states member states should be free to decide which authority determines the unavailability of deposits 51 competent authorities designated authorities resolution authorities relevant administrative authorities and dgss should cooperate with each other and exercise their powers in accordance with this directive they should cooperate from an early stage in the preparation and implementation of the resolution measures in order to set the amount by which the dgs is liable when the financial means are used to finance the resolution of credit institutions 52 the power to adopt acts in accordance with article 290 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union should be delegated to the commission in order to adjust the coverage level for the total deposits of the same depositor as laid down in this directive in line with inflation in the union on the basis of changes in the consumer price index it is of particular importance that the commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work including at expert level the commission when preparing and drawing up delegated acts should ensure a simultaneous timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the european parliament and to the council 53 in accordance with the joint political declaration of member states and the commission on explanatory documents 13 member states have undertaken to accompany in justified cases the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments with regard to this directive the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified 54 since the objective of this directive namely the harmonisation of rules concerning the functioning of dgss can not be sufficiently achieved by the member states but can rather be better achieved at union level the union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in article 5 of the treaty on european union in accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that article this directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective 55 the obligation to transpose this directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent a substantive amendment as compared to the earlier directives the obligation to transpose the provisions which are unchanged arises under the earlier directives 56 this directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the member states relating to the time limits for the transposition into national law of the directives

32014L0092	l_2014257en.01021401.xml 28.8.2014 en official journal of the european union l 257/214 directive 2014/92/eu of the european parliament and of the council of 23 july 2014 on the comparability of fees related to payment accounts payment account switching and access to payment accounts with basic features text with eea relevance the european parliament and the council of the european union having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the european union and in particular article 114 thereof having regard to the proposal from the european commission after transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments having regard to the opinion of the european central bank 1 having regard to the opinion of the european economic and social committee 2 acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 3 whereas 1 in accordance with article 26 2 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union tfeu the internal market is to comprise an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods persons services and capital is ensured fragmentation of the internal market is detrimental to competitiveness growth and job creation within the union eliminating direct and indirect obstacles to the proper functioning of the internal market is essential for its completion union action with respect to the internal market in the retail financial services sector has already substantially contributed to developing cross-border activity of payment service providers improving consumer choice and increasing the quality and transparency of the offers 2 in this respect directive 2007/64/ec of the european parliament and of the council 4 established basic transparency requirements for fees charged by payment service providers in relation to services offered on payment accounts this has substantially facilitated the activity of payment service providers creating uniform rules with respect to the provision of payment services and the information to be provided reduced the administrative burden and generated cost savings for payment service providers 3 the smooth functioning of the internal market and the development of a modern socially inclusive economy increasingly depends on the universal provision of payment services any new legislation in this regard must be part of a smart economic strategy for the union which must effectively take into account the needs of more vulnerable consumers 4 however as indicated by the european parliament in its resolution of 4 july 2012 with recommendations to the commission on access to basic banking services more must be done to improve and develop the internal market for retail banking currently the lack of transparency and comparability of fees as well as the difficulties in switching payment accounts still create barriers to the deployment of a fully integrated market contributing to low competition in the retail banking sector those problems must be tackled and high-quality standards must be achieved 5 the current conditions of the internal market could deter payment service providers from exercising their freedom to establish or to provide services within the union because of the difficulty in attracting customers when entering a new market entering new markets often entails large investment such investment is only justified if the provider foresees sufficient opportunities and a corresponding demand from consumers the low level of mobility of consumers with respect to retail financial services is to a large extent due to the lack of transparency and comparability as regards the fees and services on offer as well as difficulties in relation to the switching of payment accounts those factors also stifle demand this is particularly true in the cross-border context 6 moreover significant barriers to the completion of the internal market in the area of payment accounts may be created by the fragmentation of existing national regulatory frameworks existing provisions at national level with respect to payment accounts and particularly with respect to the comparability of fees and payment account switching diverge for switching the lack of uniform binding measures at union level has led to divergent practices and measures at national level those differences are even more marked in the area of comparability of fees where no measures even of a self-regulatory nature exist at union level should those differences become more significant in the future as payment service providers tend to tailor their practices to national markets this would raise the cost of operating across borders relative to the costs faced by domestic providers and would therefore make the pursuit of business on a cross-border basis less attractive cross-border activity in the internal market is hampered by obstacles to consumers opening a payment account abroad existing restrictive eligibility criteria may prevent union citizens from moving freely within the union providing all consumers with access to a payment account will permit their participation in the internal market and allow them to reap the benefits of the internal market 7 moreover since some prospective customers do not open payment accounts either because they are denied them or because they are not offered adequate products the potential demand for payment account services in the union is currently not fully exploited wider consumer participation in the internal market would further incentivise payment service providers to enter new markets also creating the conditions to allow all consumers to access a payment account is a necessary means of fostering their participation in the internal market and of allowing them to reap the benefits the internal market has brought about 8 transparency and comparability of fees were considered at union level in a self-regulatory initiative initiated by the banking industry however no final agreement was reached on that initiative as regards switching the common principles established in 2008 by the european banking industry committee provide a model mechanism for switching between payment accounts offered by banks located in the same member state however given their non-binding nature those common principles have been applied in an inconsistent manner throughout the union and with ineffective results moreover the common principles address payment account switching at national level only and do not address cross-border switching finally as regards access to a basic payment account commission recommendation 2011/442/eu 5 invited member states to take the necessary measures to ensure its application at the latest six months after its publication to date only a few member states comply with the main principles of that recommendation 9 in order to support effective and smooth financial mobility in the long term it is vital to establish a uniform set of rules to tackle the issue of low customer mobility and in particular to improve comparison of payment account services and fees and to incentivise payment account switching as well as to avoid discrimination on the basis of residency against consumers who intend to open and use a payment account on a cross-border basis moreover it is essential to adopt adequate measures to foster consumers ’ participation in the payment accounts market those measures will incentivise entry for payment service providers in the internal market and ensure a level playing field thereby strengthening competition and the efficient allocation of resources within the union ’ s financial retail market to the benefit of businesses and consumers also transparent fee information and switching possibilities combined with the right of access to a payment account with basic features will allow union citizens to move and shop around more easily within the union thereby benefitting from a fully functioning internal market in the area of retail financial services and will contribute to the further development of the internal market 10 it is also vital to ensure that this directive does not hamper innovation in the area of retail financial services each year new technologies become available which may render the current model of payment accounts out of date such as mobile banking services and stored value payment cards 11 this directive should not preclude member states from retaining or adopting more stringent provisions in order to protect consumers provided that such provisions are consistent with their obligations under union law and this directive 12 the provisions of this directive concerning the comparability of fees and payment account switching should apply to all payment service providers as defined in directive 2007/64/ec the provisions of this directive concerning access to payment accounts with basic features should apply only to credit institutions all provisions of this directive should concern payment accounts through which consumers are able to carry out the following transactions place funds withdraw cash and execute and receive payment transactions to and from third parties including the execution of credit transfers as a consequence accounts with more limited functions should be excluded for example accounts such as savings accounts credit card accounts where funds are usually paid in for the sole purpose of repaying a credit card debt current account mortgages or e-money accounts should in principle be excluded from the scope of this directive however should those accounts be used for day-to-day payment transactions and should they comprise all of the functions listed above they will fall within the scope of this directive accounts held by businesses even small or micro enterprises unless held in a personal capacity should fall outside the scope of this directive member states should be able to choose to extend the application of this directive to other payment service providers and other payment accounts for example those which offer more limited payment functions 13 since a payment account with basic features is a type of payment account for the purposes of this directive the provisions in respect of transparency and switching should also apply to such accounts 14 the definitions contained in this directive should be aligned as far as possible with those contained in other union legislative acts and in particular with those contained in directive 2007/64/ec and in regulation eu no 260/2012 of the european parliament and of the council 6 15 it is vital for consumers to be able to understand fees so that they can compare offers from different payment service providers and make informed decisions as to which payment account is most suitable for their needs comparison between fees can not be made where payment service providers use different terminology for the same services and provide information in different formats standardised terminology coupled with targeted fee information presented in a consistent format covering the most representative services linked to payment accounts can help consumers to both understand and compare fees 16 consumers would benefit most from information that is concise standardised and easy to compare between different payment service providers the tools made available to consumers to compare payment account offers would not have a positive impact if the time invested in going through lengthy lists of fees for different offers outweighed the benefit of choosing the offer that represents the best value those tools should be multifold and consumer testing should be conducted at this stage fee terminology should only be standardised for the most representative terms and definitions within member states in order to avoid the risk of excessive information and to facilitate swift implementation 17 the fee terminology should be determined by member states allowing for consideration of the specificities of local markets to be considered representative services should be subject to a fee at a minimum of one payment service provider in a member state in addition where the services are common to a majority of member states the terminology used to define such services should be standardised at union level thus allowing for better comparison of payment account offers across the union in order to ensure sufficient homogeneity of the national lists the european supervisory authority european banking authority ‘ eba ’ established by regulation eu no 1093/2010 of the european parliament and of the council 7 should issue guidelines to assist member states to determine the services which are most commonly used and which generate the highest cost to consumers at national level to that end member states should by 18 december 2014 indicate to the commission and eba the appropriate authorities to which those guidelines should be addressed 18 once member states have determined a provisional list of the most representative services subject to a fee at national level together with terms and definitions eba should review them to identify by means of draft regulatory technical standards the services that are common to the majority of member states and propose standardised union-level terms and definitions for them in all the official languages of the institutions of the union eba should ensure that only one term is used for each service in any official language of each member state which is also an official language of the institutions of the union this means that different terms can be used for the same service in different member states sharing the same official language of the institutions of the union thereby taking into account national specificities member states should then integrate any applicable union-level terms into their provisional lists and publish their final lists based on this 19 in order to help consumers compare payment account fees throughout the internal market easily payment service providers should provide consumers with a fee information document that states the fees for all services contained in the list of the most representative services linked to a payment account at national level the fee information document should where applicable use the standardised terms and definitions established at union level this would also contribute to establishing a level playing field between payment service providers competing in the payment account market the fee information document should not contain any other fees where a payment service provider does not offer a service appearing in the list of the most representative services linked to a payment account it should indicate this by for example marking the service as ‘ not offered ’ or ‘ not applicable ’ member states should be able to require key indicators such as a comprehensive cost indicator summarising the overall annual cost of the payment account for consumers to be provided with the fee information document in order to help consumers understand the fees they have to pay for their payment account a glossary providing clear non-technical and unambiguous explanations for at least the fees and services contained in the fee information document should be made available to them the glossary should serve as a useful tool to encourage a better understanding of the meaning of fees contributing towards empowering consumers to choose from a wider choice of payment account offers an obligation should also be introduced requiring payment service providers to inform consumers free of charge and at least annually of all the fees charged on their payment account including if applicable the overdraft interest rate and the credit interest rate this is without prejudice to the provisions on overdrafts set out in directive 2008/48/ec of the european parliament and the council 8 ex post information should be provided in a dedicated document called a ‘ statement of fees ’ it should provide an overview of interest earned and all the fees incurred in relation to the use of the payment account to enable a consumer to understand what fee expenditures relate to and to assess the need to either modify consumption patterns or move to another provider that benefit would be maximised by the ex post fee information presenting the most representative services in the same order as the ex ante fee information 20 to satisfy the needs of consumers it is necessary to ensure that fee information on payment accounts is accurate clear and comparable eba should therefore after consulting national authorities and after consumer testing develop draft implementing technical standards regarding a standardised presentation format for the fee information document and the statement of fees and the common symbols in order to ensure that they are understandable and comparable for consumers the same format order of items and headings should be followed for every fee information document and statement of fees in each member state allowing consumers to compare the two documents thereby maximising understanding and use of the information the fee information document and statement of fees should be clearly distinguishable from other communications furthermore when developing those formats eba should also take into account the fact that member states may choose to provide the fee information document and the statement of fees together with information required pursuant to other union or national legislative acts on payment accounts and related services 21 in order to ensure consistent use of applicable union-level terminology across the union member states should establish an obligation requiring payment service providers to use the applicable union-level terminology together with the remaining national standardised terminology identified in the final list when communicating with consumers including in the fee information document and the statement of fees payment service providers should be able to use brand names in their contractual commercial and marketing information to consumers as long as they clearly identify the applicable corresponding standardised term where they choose to use brand names in the fee information document or statement of fees this should be in addition to the standardised terms as a secondary designation such as in brackets or in a smaller font size 22 comparison websites that are independent are an effective means for consumers to assess the merits of different payment account offers in one place such websites can provide the right balance between the need for information to be clear and concise and the need for it to be complete and comprehensive by enabling users to obtain more detailed information where this is of interest to them they should aim at including the broadest possible range of offers so as to give a representative overview while also covering a significant part of the market they can also reduce search costs as consumers will not need to collect information separately from payment service providers it is crucial that the information given on such websites be trustworthy impartial and transparent and that consumers be informed of the availability of such websites in this regard member states should inform the public of such websites 23 in order to obtain impartial information on fees charged and interest rates applied in relation to payment accounts consumers should be able to use publicly accessible comparison websites that are operationally independent from payment service providers which means that no payment service provider should be given favourable treatment in search results member states should therefore ensure that consumers have free access to at least one such website in their respective territories such comparison websites may be operated by or on behalf of the competent authorities other public authorities and/or private operators the function of comparing fees connected to payment accounts may also be fulfilled by existing websites comparing a broad range of financial or non-financial products such websites should be operated in accordance with specified quality criteria including the requirement to provide details of their owners to provide accurate and up-to-date information to state the time of the last update to set out clear objective criteria on which the comparison will be based and to include a broad range of payment account offers covering a significant part of the market member states should be able to determine how often comparison websites are to review and update the information they provide to consumers taking into account the frequency with which payment service providers generally update their fee information member states should also determine what constitutes a broad range of payment account offers covering a significant part of the market by assessing for example how many payment service providers exist and therefore whether a simple majority or less would be sufficient and/or market share and/or their geographic location a comparison website should compare the fees payable for services contained in the list of most representative services linked to payment accounts integrating union-level terminology it is appropriate that member states should be able to require such websites to compare other information for example information on determinants of the level of services provided by payment service providers such as the number and location of branches or automated teller machines where there is only one website in a member state and that website ceases to operate or ceases to comply with the quality criteria the member state should ensure that consumers have access within a reasonable time to another comparison website at national level 24 it is current practice for payment service providers to offer a payment account in a package with products or services other than services linked to a payment account such as insurance products or financial advice that practice can be a means for payment service providers to diversify their offers and to compete against each other and in the end it can be beneficial for consumers however the commission ’ s 2009 study on tying practices in the financial sector as well as relevant consultations and consumer complaints have shown that payment service providers may offer payment accounts packaged with products not requested by consumers which are not essential for payment accounts such as household insurance moreover it has been observed that those practices may reduce transparency and comparability of prices limit purchasing options for consumers and negatively impact upon their mobility therefore member states should ensure that when payment service providers offer packaged payment accounts consumers are provided with information on whether it is possible to purchase the payment account separately and if so provide separate information regarding the applicable costs and fees associated with each of the other products or services included in the package that can be purchased separately 25 the process for switching payment accounts should be harmonised across the union at present existing measures at national level are extremely diverse and do not guarantee an adequate level of consumer protection in all member states the provision of legislative measures establishing the main principles to be followed by payment service providers when providing such a service in each member state would improve the functioning of the internal market for both consumers and payment service providers on the one hand it would guarantee a level playing field for consumers who may be interested in opening a payment account in a different member state as it would ensure that an equivalent level of protection is offered on the other hand it would reduce the differences between the regulatory measures in place at national level and would therefore reduce the administrative burden for payment service providers which intend to offer their services on a cross-border basis as a consequence the measures on switching would facilitate the provision of services related to payment accounts within the internal market 26 switching should not imply the transfer of the contract from the transferring payment service provider to the receiving payment service provider 27 consumers only have an incentive to switch payment accounts if the process does not entail an excessive administrative and financial burden therefore payment service providers should offer to consumers a clear quick and safe procedure to switch payment accounts including payment accounts with basic features such a procedure should be guaranteed when consumers want to switch from one payment service provider to another and also when consumers want to switch between different payment accounts within the same payment service provider this would allow consumers to benefit from the most convenient offers on the market and to easily change from their existing payment account to other potentially more suitable ones irrespective of whether this occurs within the same payment service provider or between different payment service providers any fees charged by payment service providers in relation to the switching service should be reasonable and in line with the actual cost incurred by payment service providers 28 member states should be allowed with regard to switching where both payment service providers are located in their territory to establish or maintain arrangements that differ from those provided for in this directive if this is clearly in the interests of the consumer 29 the switching process should be as straightforward as possible for the consumer accordingly member states should ensure that the receiving payment service provider is responsible for initiating and managing the process on behalf of the consumer member states should be able to use additional means such as a technical solution when establishing the switching service such additional means may exceed the requirements of this directive for example the switching service may be provided in a shorter time-frame or payment service providers may be required to ensure upon a consumer ’ s request the automated or manual routing of credit transfers received on the former payment account to the new payment account for a set limited period starting from receipt of the authorisation to switch such additional means may also be used by payment service providers on a voluntary basis even where this is not required by a member state 30 consumers should be allowed to ask the receiving payment service provider to switch all or part of the incoming credit transfers standing orders for credit transfers or direct debit mandates ideally within a single meeting with the receiving payment service provider to that end consumers should be able to sign one authorisation giving consent to each of the abovementioned tasks member states could require that the authorisation from the consumer be in writing but could also choose to accept equivalent means where appropriate for example where an automated system for switching is in place before giving the authorisation the consumer should be informed of all the steps of the procedure necessary to complete the switching for example the authorisation could include all the tasks that form part of the switching service and could allow for the possibility of the consumer choosing only some of those tasks 31 the cooperation of the transferring payment service provider is necessary in order for the switching to be successful the receiving payment service provider should be provided by the transferring payment service provider with all the information necessary to reinstate the payments on the other payment account however such information should not exceed what is necessary in order to carry out the switching 32 in order to facilitate cross-border account-opening the consumer should be allowed to ask the new payment service provider to set up on the new payment account all or part of standing orders for credit transfers accept direct debits from the date specified by the consumer and provide the consumer with information giving details of the new payment account preferably within a single meeting with the new payment service provider 33 consumers should not be subject to financial losses including charges and interest caused by any mistakes made by either of the payment service providers involved in the switching process in particular consumers should not bear any financial loss deriving from the payment of additional fees interest or other charges as well as fines penalties or any other type of financial detriment due to delay in the execution of the payment 34 member states should guarantee that consumers who intend to open a payment account are not discriminated against on the basis of their nationality or place of residence while it is important for credit institutions to ensure that their customers are not using the financial system for illegal purposes such as fraud money laundering or terrorism financing they should not impose barriers to consumers who want to benefit from the advantages of the internal market by opening and using payment accounts on a cross-border basis therefore the provisions of directive 2005/60/ec of the european parliament and of the council 9 should not be used as a pretext for rejecting commercially less attractive consumers 35 consumers who are legally resident in the union should not be discriminated against by reason of their nationality or place of residence or on any other ground referred to in article 21 of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union the ‘ charter ’ when applying for or accessing a payment account within the union furthermore access to payment accounts with basic features should be ensured by member states irrespective of the consumers ’ financial circumstances such as their employment status level of income credit history or personal bankruptcy 36 consumers who are legally resident in the union and who do not hold a payment account in a certain member state should be in a position to open and use a payment account with basic features in that member state the concept of ‘ legally resident in the union ’ should cover both union citizens and third country nationals who already benefit from rights conferred upon them by union acts such as council regulation eec no 1408/71 10 council directive 2003/109/ec 11 council regulation ec no 859/2003 12 and directive 2004/38/ec of the european parliament and of the council 13 it should also include people seeking asylum under the geneva convention of 28 july 1951 relating to the status of refugees the protocol thereto of 31 january 1967 and other relevant international treaties furthermore member states should be able to extend the concept of ‘ legally resident in the union ’ to other third country nationals that are present on their territory 37 member states should be able in full respect of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the treaties to require consumers who wish to open a payment account with basic features in their territory to show a genuine interest in doing so without prejudice to the requirements adopted in conformity with directive 2005/60/ec to prevent money laundering physical attendance at the premises of the credit institutions should not be required in order to show such a genuine interest 38 member states should ensure that the number of credit institutions offering payment accounts with basic features is sufficient to ensure the reach of all consumers to avoid any kind of discrimination against them and to prevent distortions of competition when determining the sufficient number of credit institutions the factors to be taken into account should include the coverage of the network of the credit institutions the size of the territory of the member state the distribution of consumers on the territory the market share of the credit institutions and whether payment accounts with basic features represent only a small part of the payment accounts provided by the credit institution in principle payment accounts with basic features should be offered by as many credit institutions as possible with a view to guaranteeing that consumers can open such accounts at premises of a credit institution that is within close reach of their place of residence and that consumers are in no way discriminated against when accessing such accounts and can use them effectively in particular member states should ensure that there is no visible discrimination illustrated by for example a different appearance of the card a different account number or a different card number however it should be possible for a member state to envisage that payment accounts with basic features are offered by a smaller number of credit institutions but this should be justified on the basis that for example those credit institutions have such a widespread presence on the territory of that member state that they could serve all consumers without forcing them to travel too far away from their home to reach them moreover consumers accessing payment accounts with basic features should not be stigmatised in any way and that objective can be better achieved if a larger number of credit institutions are designated 39 member states should be able to put in place mechanisms to assist consumers with no fixed address asylum seekers and consumers who are not granted a residence permit but whose expulsion is impossible for legal or factual reasons to fully benefit from this directive 40 when allowing credit institutions to provide at the request of a consumer an overdraft facility in relation to a payment account with basic features member states should be able to define a maximum amount and a maximum duration of any such overdraft member states should also ensure that information concerning any related fees is communicated to consumers in a transparent manner finally credit institutions should comply with directive 2008/48/ec when offering overdraft facilities in conjunction with a payment account with basic features 41 in order for users of payment accounts with basic features to be served in an appropriate way member states should require credit institutions to ensure that relevant staff are adequately trained and that potential conflicts of interest do not affect those customers negatively 42 member states should be able to permit credit institutions to refuse the opening of a payment account with basic features for consumers who already hold an active and at least equivalent payment account in the same member state in order to verify whether or not a consumer already holds a payment account credit institutions should be able to rely on a declaration of honour provided by the consumer 43 member states should ensure that credit institutions process applications for a payment account with basic features within the deadlines laid down in this directive and that in the event of refusal of such an application the credit institutions inform the consumer of the specific reasons for the refusal unless such disclosure would be contrary to national security public policy or directive 2005/60/ec 44 consumers should be guaranteed access to a range of basic payment services services linked to payment accounts with basic features should include the facility to place funds and withdraw cash consumers should be able to undertake essential payment transactions such as receiving income or benefits paying bills or taxes and purchasing goods and services including via direct debit credit transfer and the use of a payment card such services should allow the purchase of goods and services online and should give consumers the opportunity to initiate payment orders via the credit institution ’ s online facility where available however a payment account with basic features should not be restricted to online usage as this would create an obstacle for consumers without internet access member states should ensure with respect to the services related to opening operating and closing the payment account as well as placing funds and withdrawing cash and undertaking payment transactions with payment cards with the exclusion of credit cards that there are no limits to the number of operations which will be available to the consumer under the specific pricing rules laid down in this directive with respect to the execution of credit transfers and direct debits as well as transactions made by means of a credit card linked to the payment account with basic features member states should be able to determine a minimum number of operations which will be available to the consumer under the specific pricing rules laid down in this directive provided that the services to which those operations relate are for the personal use of the consumer in determining what should be considered as personal use member states should take into account existing consumer behaviour and common commercial practice the fees charged for operations above the minimum number of operations should never be higher than those charged under the usual pricing policy of the credit institution 45 in the process of identifying the services to be offered with a payment account with basic features and the minimum number of operations to be included national specificities should be taken into account in particular certain services may be considered essential in guaranteeing full use of a payment account in a certain member state due to their widespread use at the national level for example in some member states consumers still widely use cheques while that means of payment is very rarely used in other member states this directive should therefore allow member states to identify additional services that are considered essential at national level and which should be provided with a payment account with basic features in the member state concerned also member states should ensure that the fees charged by credit institutions for the offer of such additional services in relation to a payment account with basic features are reasonable 46 in order to ensure that payment accounts with basic features are available to the widest possible range of consumers they should be offered free of charge or for a reasonable fee to encourage unbanked vulnerable consumers to participate in the retail banking market member states should be able to provide that payment accounts with basic features are to be offered to those consumers on particularly advantageous terms such as free of charge member states should be free to define the mechanism to identify those consumers that can benefit from payment accounts with basic features on more advantageous terms provided that the mechanism ensures that vulnerable consumers can access a payment account with basic features in any event such an approach should be without prejudice to the right of all consumers including non-vulnerable ones to access payment accounts with basic features at least at a reasonable fee furthermore any additional charges to the consumer for non-compliance with the terms laid down in the contract should be reasonable member states should establish what constitutes a reasonable charge according to national circumstances 47 credit institutions should refuse to open or should terminate a contract for a payment account with basic features only in specific circumstances such as non-compliance with the legislation on money laundering and terrorist financing or on the prevention and investigation of crimes even in those cases a refusal can only be justified where the consumer does not comply with that legislation and not because the procedure to check compliance with the legislation is too burdensome or costly however there could be cases where a consumer abuses his right to open and use a payment account with basic features for example a member state should be able to permit credit institutions to take measures against consumers who have committed a crime such as a serious fraud against a credit institution with a view to avoiding a recurrence of such a crime such measures may include for example limiting access by that consumer to a payment account with basic features for a certain period of time besides there may be cases in which the previous refusal of an application for a payment account may be necessary in order to identify consumers who could benefit from a payment account on more advantageous terms in such a case the credit institution should inform the consumer that he may use a specific mechanism in the event of refusal of an application for a payment account for which a fee is charged as provided for in this directive to obtain access to a payment account with basic features that is free of charge both such additional cases should however be limited specific and based on precisely identified provisions of national law when identifying additional cases in which credit institutions can refuse to offer payment accounts to consumers member states should be able to include inter alia grounds of public security or public policy 48 clear and comprehensible information on the right to open and use a payment account with basic features should be provided by member states and credit institutions to consumers member states should ensure that communication measures are well-targeted and in particular that they reach out to unbanked vulnerable and mobile consumers credit institutions should actively make available to consumers accessible information and adequate assistance about the specific features of the payment account with basic features on offer their associated fees and their conditions of use and also the steps consumers should take to exercise their right to open a payment account with basic features in particular consumers should be informed that the purchase of additional services is not compulsory in order to access a payment account with basic features 49 member states should promote measures that support the education of the most vulnerable consumers providing them with guidance and assistance in the responsible management of their finances information also needs to be provided regarding the guidance that consumer organisations and national authorities may provide to consumers furthermore member states should encourage initiatives by credit institutions seeking to combine the provision of a payment account with basic features and independent financial education services 50 in order to facilitate the ability of payment service providers to provide their services on a cross-border basis for the purposes of cooperation information exchange and dispute resolution between competent authorities the competent authorities responsible for the enforcement of this directive should be those acting under the auspices of eba as set out in regulation eu no 1093/2010 or other national authorities provided that they cooperate with the authorities acting under the auspices of eba in order to carry out their duties under this directive 51 member states should designate competent authorities empowered to ensure enforcement of this directive and ensure that they are granted investigation and enforcement powers and adequate resources necessary for the performance of their duties competent authorities could act for certain aspects of this directive by application to courts competent to grant a legal decision including where appropriate by appeal this could enable member states in particular where provisions of this directive were transposed into civil law to leave the enforcement of those provisions to the relevant bodies and to the courts member states should be able to designate different competent authorities in order to enforce the wide-ranging obligations laid down in this directive for instance for some provisions member states could designate competent authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection while for others they could decide to designate prudential supervisors the option to designate different competent authorities should not affect the obligations for ongoing supervision and cooperation between the competent authorities as provided for in this directive 52 consumers should have access to effective and efficient alternative dispute resolution procedures for the settlement of disputes arising out of rights and obligations established under this directive such access is already ensured by directive 2013/11/eu of the european parliament and of the council 14 in so far as relevant contractual disputes are concerned however consumers should also have access to alternative dispute resolution procedures in the event of pre-contractual disputes concerning rights and obligations established by this directive for example when they are denied access to a payment account with basic features this directive therefore provides that consumers should have access to alternative dispute resolution procedures for the settlement of disputes concerning rights and obligations established by this directive without distinguishing between contractual and pre-contractual disputes such alternative dispute resolution procedures and the entities offering them should comply with the quality requirements established by directive 2013/11/eu compliance with this directive requires the processing of consumers ’ personal data such processing is subject to directive 95/46/ec of the european parliament and of the council 15 this directive should therefore comply with the rules laid down in directive 95/46/ec 53 on a biennial basis and for the first time within four years from the entry into force of this directive member states should obtain reliable annual statistics on the functioning of the measures introduced by this directive they should use any relevant sources of information and communicate that information to the commission the commission should provide a report on the basis of the information received from the member states for the first time after four years from the entry into force of this directive and thereafter biennially 54 a review of this directive should be carried out five years after its entry into force in order to take account of market developments such as the emergence of new types of payment accounts and payment services as well as developments in other areas of union law and the experiences of member states the report based on the review should include a list of infringement proceedings initiated by the commission in relation to this directive it should also include an assessment of the average fee levels in member states for payment accounts falling within the scope of this directive of the question whether the measures introduced have improved consumer understanding of payment account fees the comparability of payment accounts and the ease of switching payment accounts and of the number of account holders who have switched payment accounts since the transposition of this directive it should also analyse the number of providers offering payment accounts with basic features and the number of such accounts that have been opened including by previously unbanked consumers examples of best practices among member states for reducing consumer exclusion from access to payment services and the average annual fees levied for payment accounts with basic features it should also assess the costs and benefits of implementing union-wide portability of payment accounts the feasibility of a framework for ensuring automated redirection of payments from one payment account to another within the same member state combined with automated notifications to payees or payers when their transfers are redirected and of extending the switching services to cases where the receiving and transferring payment service provider are located in different member states it should also include an assessment of the effectiveness of existing measures and the need for additional measures to increase financial inclusion and to assist vulnerable members of society in relation to over-indebtedness also it should assess whether the provisions on the information to be provided by payment service providers when offering packaged products are sufficient or whether additional measures are needed it should also assess the need for additional measures with regard to comparison websites and the need for an accreditation of comparison websites the commission should submit that report to the european parliament and to the council accompanied if appropriate by legislative proposals 55 this directive respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the charter in accordance with article 6 1 of the treaty on european union teu 56 since the objectives of this directive namely to facilitate the transparency and comparability of fees related to payment accounts payment account switching and access to payment accounts with basic features can not be sufficiently achieved by the member states

principle of subsidiarity as set out in article 5 of the teu in accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that article this directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives 57 in accordance with the joint political declaration of 28 september 2011 of member states and the commission on explanatory documents 16 member states have undertaken to accompany in justified cases the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts

services in the internal market amending directives 2002/65/ec 2009/110/ec and 2013/36/eu and regulation eu no 1093/2010 and repealing directive 2007/64/ec text with eea relevance the european parliament and the council of the european union having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the european union and in particular article 114 thereof having regard to the proposal from the european commission after transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments having regard to the opinion of the european central bank 1 having regard to the opinion of the european economic and social committee 2 acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 3 whereas 1 in recent years significant progress has been achieved in integrating retail payments in the union in particular in the context of the union acts on payments in particular through directive 2007/64/ec of the european parliament and of the council 4 regulation ec no 924/2009 of the european parliament and of the council 5 directive 2009/110/ec of the european parliament and of the council 6 and regulation eu no 260/2012 of the european parliament and of the council 7 directive 2011/83/eu of the european parliament and of the council 8 has further complemented the legal framework for payment services by setting a specific limit on the ability of retailers to surcharge their customers for the use of a given means of payment 2 the revised union legal framework on payment services is complemented by regulation eu 2015/751 of the european parliament and of the council 9 that regulation introduces in particular rules on the charging of interchange fees for card-based transactions and aims to further accelerate the achievement of an effective integrated market for card-based payments 3 directive 2007/64/ec was adopted in december 2007 on the basis of a commission proposal of december 2005. since then the retail payments market has experienced significant technical innovation with rapid growth in the number of electronic and mobile payments and the emergence of new types of payment services in the market place which challenges the current framework 4 the review of the union legal framework on payment services and in particular the analysis of the impact of directive 2007/64/ec and the consultation on the commission green paper of 11 january 2012 entitled ‘ towards an integrated european market for card internet and mobile payments ’ have shown that developments have given rise to significant challenges from a regulatory perspective significant areas of the payments market in particular card internet and mobile payments remain fragmented along national borders many innovative payment products or services do not fall entirely or in large part within the scope of directive 2007/64/ec furthermore the scope of directive 2007/64/ec and in particular the elements excluded from its scope such as certain payment-related activities has proved in some cases to be too ambiguous too general or simply outdated taking into account market developments this has resulted in legal uncertainty potential security risks in the payment chain and a lack of consumer protection in certain areas it has proven difficult for payment service providers to launch innovative safe and easy-to-use digital payment services and to provide consumers and retailers with effective convenient and secure payment methods in the union in that context there is a large positive potential which needs to be more consistently explored 5 the continued development of an integrated internal market for safe electronic payments is crucial in order to support the growth of the union economy and to ensure that consumers merchants and companies enjoy choice and transparency of payment services to benefit fully from the internal market 6 new rules should be established to close the regulatory gaps while at the same time providing more legal clarity and ensuring consistent application of the legislative framework across the union equivalent operating conditions should be guaranteed to existing and new players on the market enabling new means of payment to reach a broader market and ensuring a high level of consumer protection in the use of those payment services across the union as a whole this should generate efficiencies in the payment system as a whole and lead to more choice and more transparency of payment services while strengthening the trust of consumers in a harmonised payments market 7 in recent years the security risks relating to electronic payments have increased this is due to the growing technical complexity of electronic payments the continuously growing volumes of electronic payments worldwide and emerging types of payment services safe and secure payment services constitute a vital condition for a well-functioning payment services market users of payment services should therefore be adequately protected against such risks payment services are essential for the functioning of vital economic and social activities 8 the provisions of this directive on transparency and information requirements for payment service providers and on rights and obligations in relation to the provision and use of payment services should also apply where appropriate to transactions where one of the payment service providers is located outside the european economic area eea in order to avoid divergent approaches across member states to the detriment of consumers where appropriate those provisions should be extended to transactions in all official currencies between payment service providers that are located within the eea 9 money remittance is a simple payment service that is usually based on cash provided by a payer to a payment service provider which remits the corresponding amount for example via a communication network to a payee or to another payment service provider acting on behalf of the payee in some member states supermarkets merchants and other retailers provide to the public a corresponding service enabling them to pay utilities and other regular household bills those bill-paying services should be treated as money remittance unless the competent authorities consider the activity to fall under another payment service 10 this directive introduces a neutral definition of acquiring of payment transactions in order to capture not only the traditional acquiring models structured around the use of payment cards but also different business models including those where more than one acquirer is involved this should ensure that merchants receive the same protection regardless of the payment instrument used where the activity is the same as the acquiring of card transactions technical services provided to payment service providers such as the mere processing and storage of data or the operation of terminals should not be considered to constitute acquiring moreover some acquiring models do not provide for an actual transfer of funds by the acquirer to the payee because the parties may agree upon other forms of settlement 11 the exclusion from the scope of directive 2007/64/ec of payment transactions through a commercial agent on behalf of the payer or the payee is applied very differently across the member states certain member states allow the use of the exclusion by e-commerce platforms that act as an intermediary on behalf of both individual buyers and sellers without a real margin to negotiate or conclude the sale or purchase of goods or services such application of the exclusion goes beyond the intended scope set out in that directive and has the potential to increase risks for consumers as those providers remain outside the protection of the legal framework differing application practices also distort competition in the payment market to address those concerns the exclusion should therefore apply when agents act only on behalf of the payer or only on behalf of the payee regardless of whether or not they are in possession of client funds where agents act on behalf of both the payer and the payee such as certain e-commerce platform they should be excluded only if they do not at any time enter into possession or control of client funds 12 this directive should not apply to the activities of cash-in-transit companies cits and cash management companies cmcs where the activities concerned are limited to the physical transport of banknotes and coins 13 feedback from the market shows that the payment activities covered by the limited network exclusion often comprise significant payment volumes and values and offer to consumers hundreds or thousands of different products and services that does not fit the purpose of the limited network exclusion as provided for in directive 2007/64/ec and implies greater risks and no legal protection for payment service users in particular consumers and clear disadvantages for regulated market actors to help limit those risks it should not be possible to use the same instrument to make payment transactions to acquire goods and services within more than one limited network or to acquire an unlimited range of goods and services a payment instrument should be considered to be used within such a limited network if it can be used only in the following circumstances first for the purchase of goods and services in a specific retailer or specific retail chain where the entities involved are directly linked by a commercial agreement which for example provides for the use of a single payment brand and that payment brand is used at the points of sale and appears where feasible on the payment instrument that can be used there second for the purchase of a very limited range of goods or services such as where the scope of use is effectively limited to a closed number of functionally connected goods or services regardless of the geographical location of the point of sale or third where the payment instrument is regulated by a national or regional public authority for specific social or tax purposes to acquire specific goods or services 14 payment instruments covered by the limited network exclusion could include store cards fuel cards membership cards public transport cards parking ticketing meal vouchers or vouchers for specific services which are sometimes subject to a specific tax or labour legal framework designed to promote the use of such instruments to meet the objectives laid down in social legislation where such a specific-purpose instrument develops into a general-purpose instrument the exclusion from the scope of this directive should no longer apply instruments which can be used for purchases in stores of listed merchants should not be excluded from the scope of this directive as such instruments are typically designed for a network of service providers which is continuously growing the limited network exclusion should apply in combination with the obligation of potential payment service providers to notify activities falling within its scope 15 directive 2007/64/ec excludes from its scope certain payment transactions by means of telecom or information technology devices where the network operator not only acts as an intermediary for the delivery of digital goods and services through the device in question but also adds value to those goods or services in particular that exclusion allows for so-called operator billing or direct to phone-bill purchases which starting with ringtones and premium sms services contribute to the development of new business models based on the low-value sale of digital content and voice-based services those services include entertainment such as chat downloads such as video music and games information such as on weather news sports updates stocks and directory enquiries tv and radio participation such as voting competition entry and provision of live feedback feedback from the market shows no evidence that such payment transactions trusted by consumers as convenient for low-threshold payments have developed into a general payment intermediation service however due to the ambiguous wording of the relevant exclusion it has been implemented differently across member states leading to a lack of legal certainty for operators and consumers and occasionally allowing payment intermediation services to claim eligibility for an unlimited exclusion from the scope of directive 2007/64/ec it is therefore appropriate to clarify and narrow the scope of eligibility for that exclusion for such service providers by specifying the types of payment transactions to which it applies 16 the exclusion relating to certain payment transactions by means of telecom or information technology devices should focus specifically on micro-payments for digital content and voice-based services a clear reference to payment transactions for the purchase of electronic tickets should be introduced to take into account the development in payments where in particular customers can order pay for obtain and validate electronic tickets from any location and at any time using mobile phones or other devices electronic tickets allow and facilitate the delivery of services that consumers could otherwise purchase in paper ticket form and include transport entertainment car parking and entry to venues but exclude physical goods they thus reduce the production and distribution costs connected with traditional paper-based ticketing channels and increase customer convenience by providing new and simple ways to purchase tickets in order to ease the burden on entities that collect charitable donations payment transactions in relation to such donations should also be excluded member states should in accordance with national law be free to limit the exclusion to donations collected in favour of registered charitable organisations the exclusion as a whole should apply only where the value of payment transactions is below a specified threshold in order to limit it clearly to payments with a low risk profile 17 the single euro payments area sepa has facilitated the creation of union wide ‘ payment factories ’ and ‘ collection factories ’ allowing for the centralisation of payment transactions of the same group in that respect payment transactions between a parent undertaking and its subsidiary or between subsidiaries of the same parent undertaking provided by a payment service provider belonging to the same group should be excluded from the scope of this directive the collection of payment orders on behalf of a group by a parent undertaking or its subsidiary for onward transmission to a payment service provider should not be considered to be a payment service for the purposes of this directive 18 directive 2007/64/ec excludes from its scope payment services offered by deployers of automated teller machines atms independent from account servicing payment service providers that exclusion has stimulated the growth of independent atm services in many member states in particular in less populated areas excluding that fast-growing part of the atm market from the scope of this directive completely could however lead to confusion about withdrawal charges in cross-border situations this could lead to double charging for the same withdrawal by the account servicing payment service provider and by the atm deployer consequently in order to maintain the provision of atm services while ensuring clarity with regard to withdrawal charges it is appropriate to maintain the exclusion but to require atm operators to comply with specific transparency provisions of this directive moreover charges applied by atm operators should be without prejudice to regulation ec no 924/2009 19 service providers seeking to benefit from an exclusion from the scope of directive 2007/64/ec often have not consulted authorities on whether their activities are covered by or excluded from that directive but have relied on their own assessments this has led to a differing application of certain exclusions across member states it also appears that some exclusions may have been used by payment service providers to redesign business models so that the payment activities offered would be outside the scope of that directive this may result in increased risks for payment service users and diverging conditions for payment service providers in the internal market service providers should therefore be obliged to notify relevant activities to competent authorities so that the competent authorities can assess whether the requirements set out in the relevant provisions are fulfilled and to ensure a homogenous interpretation of the rules throughout the internal market in particular for all exclusions based on the respect of a threshold a notification procedure should be provided in order to ensure compliance with the specific requirements 20 moreover it is important to include a requirement for potential payment service providers to notify competent authorities of the activities that they provide in the framework of a limited network on the basis of the criteria set out in this directive if the value of payment transactions exceeds a certain threshold competent authorities should assess whether the activities so notified can be considered to be activities provided in the framework of a limited network 21 the definition of payment services should be technologically neutral and should allow for the development of new types of payment services while ensuring equivalent operating conditions for both existing and new payment service providers 22 this directive should follow the approach taken in directive 2007/64/ec which covers all types of electronic payment services it would therefore not be appropriate for the new rules to apply to services where the transfer of funds from the payer to the payee or their transport is executed solely in bank notes and coins or where the transfer is based on a paper cheque paper-based bill of exchange promissory note or other instrument paper-based vouchers or cards drawn upon a payment service provider or other party with a view to placing funds at the disposal of the payee 23 this directive should not apply to payment transactions made in cash since a single payments market for cash already exists nor should this directive apply to payment transactions based on paper cheques since by their nature paper cheques can not be processed as efficiently as other means of payment good practice in that area should however be based on the principles set out in this directive 24 it is necessary to specify the categories of payment service providers which may legitimately provide payment services throughout the union namely credit institutions which take deposits from users that can be used to fund payment transactions and which should continue to be subject to the prudential requirements laid down in directive 2013/36/eu of the european parliament and of the council 10 electronic money institutions which issue electronic money that can be used to fund payment transactions and which should continue to be subject to the prudential requirements laid down in directive 2009/110/ec payment institutions and post office giro institutions which are so entitled under national law the application of that legal framework should be confined to service providers who provide payment services as a regular occupation or business activity in accordance with this directive 25 this directive lays down rules on the execution of payment transactions where the funds are electronic money as defined in directive 2009/110/ec this directive does not however regulate the issuance of electronic money as provided for in directive 2009/110/ec therefore payment institutions should not be allowed to issue electronic money 26 directive 2007/64/ec established a prudential regime introducing a single licence for all providers of payment services which are not connected to taking deposits or issuing electronic money to that end directive 2007/64/ec introduced a new category of payment service providers namely ‘ payment institutions ’ by providing for the authorisation subject to a set of strict and comprehensive conditions of legal persons outside the existing categories to provide payment services throughout the union thus the same conditions should apply union wide to such services 27 since the adoption of directive 2007/64/ec new types of payment services have emerged especially in the area of internet payments in particular payment initiation services in the field of e-commerce have evolved those payment services play a part in e-commerce payments by establishing a software bridge between the website of the merchant and the online banking platform of the payer ’ s account servicing payment service provider in order to initiate internet payments on the basis of a credit transfer 28 moreover technological developments have given rise to the emergence of a range of complementary services in recent years such as account information services those services provide the payment service user with aggregated online information on one or more payment accounts held with one or more other payment service providers and accessed via online interfaces of the account servicing payment service provider the payment service user is thus able to have an overall view of its financial situation immediately at any given moment those services should also be covered by this directive in order to provide consumers with adequate protection for their payment and account data as well as legal certainty about the status of account information service providers 29 payment initiation services enable the payment initiation service provider to provide comfort to a payee that the payment has been initiated in order to provide an incentive to the payee to release the goods or to deliver the service without undue delay such services offer a low-cost solution for both merchants and consumers and provide consumers with a possibility to shop online even if they do not possess payment cards since payment initiation services are currently not subject to directive 2007/64/ec they are not necessarily supervised by a competent authority and are not required to comply with directive 2007/64/ec this raises a series of legal issues such as consumer protection security and liability as well as competition and data protection issues in particular regarding protection of the payment service users ’ data in accordance with union data protection rules the new rules should therefore respond to those issues 30 the personalised security credentials used for secure customer authentication by the payment service user or by the payment initiation service provider are usually those issued by the account servicing payment service providers payment initiation service providers do not necessarily enter into a contractual relationship with the account servicing payment service providers and regardless of the business model used by the payment initiation service providers the account servicing payment service providers should make it possible for payment initiation service providers to rely on the authentication procedures provided by the account servicing payments service providers to initiate a specific payment on behalf of the payer 31 when exclusively providing payment initiation services the payment initiation service provider does not at any stage of the payment chain hold the user ’ s funds when a payment initiation service provider intends to provide payment services in relation to which it holds user funds it should obtain full authorisation for those services 32 payment initiation services are based on direct or indirect access for the payment initiation service provider to the payer ’ s account an account servicing payment service provider which provides a mechanism for indirect access should also allow direct access for the payment initiation service providers 33 this directive should aim to ensure continuity in the market enabling existing and new service providers regardless of the business model applied by them to offer their services with a clear and harmonised regulatory framework pending the application of those rules without prejudice to the need to ensure the security of payment transactions and customer protection against demonstrable risk of fraud member states the commission the european central bank ecb and the european supervisory authority european banking authority established by regulation eu no 1093/2010 of the european parliament and of the council 11 eba should guarantee fair competition in that market avoiding unjustifiable discrimination against any existing player on the market any payment service provider including the account servicing payment service provider of the payment service user should be able to offer payment initiation services 34 this directive does not substantially change the conditions for granting and maintaining authorisation as payment institutions as in directive 2007/64/ec the conditions include prudential requirements proportionate to the operational and financial risks faced by such bodies in the course of their business in that connection there is a need for a sound regime of initial capital combined with on-going capital which could be elaborated in a more sophisticated way in due course depending on the needs of the market due to the range of variety in the payment services area this directive should allow various methods combined with a certain range of supervisory discretion to ensure that the same risks are treated the same way for all payment service providers the requirements for the payment institutions should reflect the fact that payment institutions engage in more specialised and limited activities thus generating risks that are narrower and easier to monitor and control than those that arise across the broader spectrum of activities of credit institutions in particular payment institutions should be prohibited from accepting deposits from users and should be permitted to use funds received from users only for rendering payment services the required prudential rules including the initial capital should be appropriate to the risk relating to the respective payment service provided by the payment institution payment service providers that provide only payment initiation services should be considered to be of a medium risk with regard to the initial capital 35 payment initiation service providers and account information service providers when exclusively providing those services do not hold client funds accordingly it would be disproportionate to impose own funds requirements on those new market players nevertheless it is important that they be able to meet their liabilities in relation to their activities they should therefore be required to hold either professional indemnity insurance or a comparable guarantee eba should develop guidelines in accordance with article 16 of regulation eu no 1093/2010 on the criteria to be used by member states to establish the minimum monetary amount of professional indemnity insurance or comparable guarantee eba should not differentiate between professional indemnity insurance and a comparable guarantee as they should be interchangeable 36 in order to avoid abuses of the right of establishment it is necessary to require that the payment institution requesting authorisation in the member state provide at least part of its payment services business in that member state 37 provision should be made for payment service user funds to be kept separate from the payment institution ’ s funds safeguarding requirements are necessary when a payment institution is in possession of payment service user funds where the same payment institution executes a payment transaction for both the payer and the payee and a credit line is provided to the payer it might be appropriate to safeguard the funds in favour of the payee once they represent the payee ’ s claim towards the payment institution payment institutions should also be subject to effective anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing requirements 38 this directive does not change the account reporting obligations of payment institutions or their obligation to carry out audits on their annual and consolidated accounts payment institutions are required to draw up their annual and consolidated accounts in accordance with council directive 86/635/eec 12 and directive 2013/34/eu of the european parliament and of the council 13 the annual accounts and consolidated accounts are to be audited unless the payment institution is exempted from that obligation under those directives 39 when engaging in the provision of one or more of the payment services covered by this directive payment service providers should always hold payment accounts used exclusively for payment transactions in order to enable payment service providers to provide payment services it is indispensable that they have the possibility to open and maintain accounts with credit institutions member states should ensure that access to such accounts be provided in a manner that is not discriminatory and that is proportionate to the legitimate aim it intends to achieve while access can be basic it should always be sufficiently extensive for the payment institution to be able to provide its services in an unobstructed and efficient way 40 this directive should regulate the granting of credit by payment institutions namely the granting of credit lines and the issuance of credit cards only where it is closely linked to payment services only if credit is granted in order to facilitate payment services and such credit is of a short-term nature and is granted for a period not exceeding 12 months including on a revolving basis is it appropriate to allow payment institutions to grant such credit with regard to their cross-border activities on condition that it is refinanced using mainly the payment institution ’ s own funds as well as other funds from the capital markets and not the funds held on behalf of clients for payment services such rules should be without prejudice to directive 2008/48/ec of the european parliament and of the council 14 or other relevant union law or national measures regarding conditions for granting credit to consumers that are not harmonised by this directive 41 overall the functioning of cooperation between the national competent authorities responsible for granting authorisations to payment institutions carrying out controls and deciding on the withdrawal of any authorisations granted has proven to work satisfactorily however cooperation between competent authorities should be enhanced both with regard to the information exchanged as well as a coherent application and interpretation of this directive where an authorised payment institution would like to provide payment services in a member state other than its home member state in exercise of the right of establishment or the freedom to provide services ‘ passporting ’ including through the internet eba should assist in resolving disputes between competent authorities in the context of cross-border cooperation in accordance with regulation eu no 1093/2010 it should also prepare a set of draft regulatory technical standards on cooperation and data exchange 42 in order to enhance transparency of the operation of payment institutions that are authorised by or registered with competent authorities of the home member state including their agents and to ensure a high level of consumer protection in the union it is necessary to ensure easy public access to the list of the entities providing payment services eba should therefore develop and operate a central register in which it publishes a list of the names of the entities providing payment services member states should ensure that the data that they provide is kept up to date those measures should also contribute to the enhancement of the cooperation between the competent authorities 43 the availability of accurate up-to-date information should be enhanced by requiring payment institutions to inform the competent authority of their home member state without undue delay of any changes affecting the accuracy of the information and evidence provided with regard to the authorisation including additional agents or entities to which activities are outsourced competent authorities should also in the event of doubt verify that the information received is correct 44 member states should be able to require that payment institutions operating on their territory whose head office is situated in another member state report to them periodically on their activities in their territories for information or statistical purposes where those payment institutions operate pursuant to the right of establishment it should be possible for that information also to be used for monitoring compliance with titles iii and iv of this directive and member states should be able to require those payment institutions to appoint a central contact point in their territory in order to facilitate the supervision of networks of agents by competent authorities eba should develop draft regulatory standards setting out the criteria to determine when the appointment of a central contact point is appropriate and what its functions should be the requirement to appoint a central contact point should be proportionate to achieving the aim of adequate communication and information reporting on compliance with titles iii and iv in the host member state 45 in emergency situations where immediate action is necessary to address a serious threat to the collective interests of the payment service users in the host member state such as large scale fraud it should be possible for the competent authorities of the host member state to take precautionary measures in parallel with the cross-border cooperation between competent authorities of the host and the home member state and pending measures by the competent authority of the home member state those measures should be appropriate proportionate to the aim non-discriminatory and temporary in nature any measures should be properly justified the competent authorities of the home member state of the relevant payment institution and other authorities concerned such as the commission and eba should be informed in advance or if not possible in view of the emergency situation without undue delay 46 while this directive specifies the minimum set of powers competent authorities should have when supervising the compliance of payment institutions those powers are to be exercised while respecting fundamental rights including the right to privacy without prejudice to the control of an independent authority national data protection authority and in accordance with the charter of fundamental rights of the european union member states should have in place adequate and effective safeguards where it is possible that the exercise of those powers could lead to abuse or arbitrariness amounting to serious interference with such rights for instance where appropriate through the prior authorisation of the judicial authority of the member state concerned 47 it is important to ensure that all persons providing payment services be brought within the ambit of certain minimum legal and regulatory requirements thus it is desirable to require the registration of the identity and whereabouts of all persons providing payment services including of persons which are unable to meet the full range of conditions for authorisation as payment institutions such an approach is in line with the rationale of special recommendation vi of the financial action task force on money laundering which provides for a mechanism whereby payment service providers who are unable to meet all of the conditions set out in that recommendation may nevertheless be treated as payment institutions for those purposes even where persons are exempt from all or part of the conditions for authorisation member states should enter them in the register of payment institutions however it is essential to make the possibility of an exemption subject to strict requirements relating to the value of payment transactions payment institutions benefiting from an exemption should not benefit from the right of establishment or freedom to provide services and should not indirectly exercise those rights while being a member of a payment system 48 in view of the specific nature of the activity performed and the risks connected to the provision of account information services it is appropriate to provide for a specific prudential regime for account information service providers account information service providers should be allowed to provide services on a cross-border basis benefiting from the ‘ passporting ’ rules 49 it is essential for any payment service provider to be able to access the services of technical infrastructures of payment systems such access should however be subject to appropriate requirements in order to ensure integrity and stability of those systems each payment service provider applying for participation in a payment system should bear the risk of its own choice of system and provide proof to the payment system that its internal arrangements are sufficiently robust against all kinds of risk those payment systems typically include the four-party card schemes as well as major systems processing credit transfers and direct debits in order to ensure equality of treatment throughout the union as between the different categories of authorised payment service providers according to the terms of their licence it is necessary to clarify the rules concerning access to payment systems 50 provision should be made for the non-discriminatory treatment of authorised payment institutions and credit institutions so that any payment service provider competing in the internal market is able to use the services of the technical infrastructures of those payment systems under the same conditions it is appropriate to provide for different treatment for authorised payment service providers and for those benefiting from an exemption under this directive as well as from the exemption under the article 3 of directive 2009/110/ec due to the differences in their respective prudential framework in any case differences in price conditions should be allowed only where that is motivated by differences in costs incurred by the payment service providers this should be without prejudice to member states ’ right to limit access to systemically important systems in accordance with directive 98/26/ec of the european parliament and of the council 15 and without prejudice to the competence of the ecb and the european system of central banks concerning access to payment systems 51 this directive is without prejudice to the scope of application of directive 98/26/ec however in order to ensure fair competition between payment service providers a participant in a designated payment system subject to the conditions of directive 98/26/ec which provides services in relation to such a system to an authorised or registered payment service provider should also when requested to do so grant access to such services in an objective proportionate and non-discriminatory manner to any other authorised or registered payment service provider payment service providers that are granted such access should not however be considered to be participants as defined in directive 98/26/ec and hence should not benefit from the protection granted under that directive 52 the provisions relating to access to payment systems should not apply to systems set up and operated by a single payment service provider such payment systems can operate either in direct competition to payment systems or more typically in a market niche not adequately covered by payment systems such systems include three-party schemes such as three-party card schemes to the extent that they never operate as de facto four-party card schemes for example by relying upon licensees agents or co-brand partners such systems also typically include payment services offered by telecommunication providers where the scheme operator is the payment service provider both to the payer and to the payee as well as internal systems of banking groups in order to stimulate the competition that can be provided by such closed payment systems to established mainstream payment systems it would not be appropriate to grant third parties access to those closed proprietary payment systems however such closed systems should always be subject to union and national competition rules which may require that access be granted to the schemes in order to maintain effective competition in payments markets 53 as consumers and undertakings are not in the same position they do not need the same level of protection while it is important to guarantee consumer rights by provisions from which it is not possible to derogate by contract it is reasonable to let undertakings and organisations agree otherwise when they are not dealing with consumers however member states should be able to provide that microenterprises as defined in commission recommendation 2003/361/ec 16 be treated in the same way as consumers in any case certain core provisions of this directive should always apply irrespective of the status of the user 54 this directive should specify the obligations on payment service providers as regards the provision of information to the payment service users who should receive the same high level of clear information about payment services in order to make well-informed choices and be able to choose freely within the union in the interest of transparency this directive lays down the harmonised requirements needed to ensure that necessary sufficient and comprehensible information is given to the payment service users with regard to the payment service contract and the payment transactions in order to promote the smooth functioning of the single market in payment services member states should adopt only those information provisions laid down in this directive 55 consumers should be protected against unfair and misleading practices in accordance with directive 2005/29/ec of the european parliament and the council 17 as well as with directives 2000/31/ec 18 2002/65/ec 19 2008/48/ec 2011/83/eu 20 and 2014/92/eu 21 of the european parliament and the council the provisions of those directives continue to apply however the relationship between the pre-contractual information requirements laid down in this directive and directive 2002/65/ec should in particular be clarified 56 in order to enhance efficiency the information required should be proportionate to the needs of users and should be communicated in a standard format however the information requirements for a single payment transaction should be different from those of a framework contract which provides for a series of payment transactions 57 in practice framework contracts and the payment transactions covered by them are far more common and economically significant than single payment transactions if there is a payment account or a specific payment instrument a framework contract is required therefore the requirements for prior information on framework contracts should be comprehensive and information should always be provided on paper or on another durable medium such as printouts by account printers cd-roms dvds the hard drives of personal computers on which electronic mail can be stored and internet sites provided that such sites are accessible for future reference for a sufficient period of time for the purposes of accessing the information and provided that these sites allow the reproduction of the information stored there in an unaltered form however it should be possible for the payment service provider and the payment service user to agree in the framework contract on the manner in which subsequent information on executed payment transactions is to be given for instance that in internet banking all information on the payment account be made available online 58 in single payment transactions only the essential information should always be given on the payment service provider ’ s own initiative as the payer is usually present when giving the payment order it should not be necessary to require in every case that information be provided on paper or on another durable medium the payment service provider should be able to give information orally over the counter or make it otherwise easily accessible for example by keeping the conditions on a notice board on the premises information should also be given on where to find other more detailed information for example on the website however if the consumer so requests the essential information should also be given on paper or on another durable medium 59 this directive should provide for a right for consumers to receive relevant information free of charge before being bound by any payment service contract consumers should also be able to request prior information as well as the framework contract on paper free of charge at any time during the contractual relationship so as to enable them both to compare the services and conditions offered by payment service providers and in the case of any dispute to verify their contractual rights and obligations thereby maintaining a high level of consumer protection those provisions should be compatible with directive 2002/65/ec the specific provisions on free information in this directive should not have the effect of allowing charges to be imposed for the provision of information to consumers under other applicable directives 60 the way in which the required information is to be given by the payment service provider to the payment service user should take into account the needs of the latter as well as practical technical aspects and cost-efficiency depending on the situation with regard to the agreement in the respective payment service contract this directive should therefore distinguish between two ways in which information is to be given by the payment service provider either the information should be provided i.e actively communicated by the payment service provider at the appropriate time as required by this directive without any prompting by the payment service user or the information should be made available to the payment service user on the basis of a request for further information in the second situation the payment service user should take active steps in order to obtain the information such as requesting it explicitly from the payment service provider logging into a bank account mail box or inserting a bank card into a printer for account statements for such purposes the payment service provider should ensure that access to the information is possible and that the information is available to the payment service user 61 the consumer should receive basic information on executed payment transactions at no additional charge in the case of a single payment transaction the payment service provider should not charge separately for that information similarly subsequent information on payment transactions under a framework contract should also be provided on a monthly basis free of charge however taking into account the importance of transparency in pricing and differing customer needs the parties should be able to agree on charges for more frequent or additional information in order to take into account different national practices member states should be able to require that monthly statements of payment accounts on paper or in another durable medium are always to be given free of charge 62 in order to facilitate customer mobility it should be possible for consumers to terminate a framework contract without incurring charges however for contracts terminated by the consumer less than 6 months after their entry into force payment service providers should be allowed to apply charges in line with the costs incurred due to the termination of the framework contract by the consumer for consumers the period of notice agreed should be no longer than 1 month and for payment service providers no shorter than 2 months this directive should be without prejudice to the payment service provider ’ s obligation to terminate the payment service contract in exceptional circumstances under other relevant union or national law such as that on money laundering or terrorist financing any action targeting the freezing of funds or any specific measure linked to the prevention and investigation of crimes 63 in order to ensure a high level of consumer protection member states should in the interests of the consumer be able to maintain or introduce restrictions or prohibitions on unilateral changes in the conditions of a framework contract for instance if there is no justified reason for such a change 64 contractual provisions should not as their object or effect discriminate against consumers who are legally resident in the union on the grounds of their nationality or place of residence for example where a framework contract provides for the right to block the payment instrument for objectively justified reasons the payment service provider should not be able to invoke that right merely because the payment service user has changed its place of residence within the union 65 with regard to charges experience has shown that the sharing of charges between a payer and a payee is the most efficient system since it facilitates the straight-through processing of payments provision should therefore be made for charges to be levied in the normal course directly on the payer and the payee by their respective payment service providers the amount of any charges levied may also be zero as the provisions of this directive should not affect the practice whereby the payment service provider does not charge consumers for crediting their accounts similarly depending on the contract terms a payment service provider may charge only the payee merchant for the use of the payment service in which case no charges are imposed on the payer it is possible that the payment systems impose charges by way of a subscription fee the provisions on the amount transferred or any charges levied have no direct impact on pricing between payment service providers or any intermediaries 66 different national practices concerning charging for the use of a given payment instrument ‘ surcharging ’ have led to extreme heterogeneity of the union ’ s payments market and have become a source of confusion for consumers in particular in the e-commerce and cross-border context merchants located in member states where surcharging is allowed offer products and services in member states where surcharging is prohibited and surcharges the consumer there are also many examples of merchants surcharging consumers at levels much higher than the cost borne by the merchant for the use of a specific payment instrument moreover a strong rationale for revising surcharging practices is supported by the fact that regulation eu 2015/751 establishes rules for interchange fees for card-based payments interchange fees constitute the main component of merchant charges for cards and card-based payments surcharging is the steering practice sometimes used by merchants to compensate for the additional costs of card-based payments regulation eu 2015/751 imposes limits on the level of interchange fees those limits will apply before the prohibition set out in this directive consequently member states should consider preventing payees from requesting charges for the use of payment instruments for which the interchange fees are regulated in chapter ii of regulation eu 2015/751 67 while this directive recognises the relevance of payment institutions credit institutions remain the principal gateway for consumers to obtain payment instruments the issuing of a card-based payment instrument by a payment service provider whether a credit institution or a payment institution other than that servicing the account of the customer would provide increased competition in the market and thus more choice and a better offer for consumers whilst today most payments at the point of sale are card based the current degree of innovation in the field of payments might lead to the rapid emergence of new payment channels in the forthcoming years it is therefore appropriate that in its review of this directive the commission gives particular consideration to those developments and to whether the scope of the provision on the confirmation on the availability of funds needs to be revised for the payment service provider issuing the card based payment instrument particularly debit cards obtaining confirmation of availability of funds on the customer ’ s account from the account servicing payment service provider would enable the issuer to better manage and to reduce its credit risk at the same time that confirmation should not allow the account servicing payment service provider to block funds on the payer ’ s payment account 68 the use of a card or card-based payment instrument for making a payment often triggers the generation of a message confirming availability of funds and two resulting payment transactions the first transaction takes place between the issuer and the merchant ’ s account servicing payment service provider while the second usually a direct debit takes place between the payer ’ s account servicing payment service provider and the issuer both transactions should be treated in the same way as any other equivalent transactions payment service providers issuing card-based payment instruments should enjoy the same rights and should be subject to the same obligations under this directive regardless of whether or not they are the account servicing payment service provider of the payer in particular in terms of responsibility e.g authentication and liability vis-à-vis the different actors in the payment chain since the payment service provider ’ s request and the confirmation on the availability of the funds can be made through existing secure communication channels technical procedures and infrastructure for communication between payment initiation service providers or account information service providers and account servicing payment service providers while respecting the necessary security measures there should be no additional costs for payment services providers or cardholders furthermore whether the payment transaction takes place in an internet environment the merchant ’ s website or in retail premises the account servicing payment service provider should be obliged to provide the confirmation requested by the issuer only where accounts held by the account servicing payment service providers are electronically accessible for that confirmation at least online given the specific nature of electronic money it should not be possible to apply that mechanism to payment transactions initiated through card- based payment instruments on which electronic money as defined in directive 2009/110/ec is stored 69 the obligation to keep personalised security credentials safe is of the utmost importance to protect the funds of the payment service user and to limit the risks relating to fraud and unauthorised access to the payment account however terms and conditions or other obligations imposed by payment service providers on payment service users in relation to keeping personalised security credentials safe should not be drafted in a way that prevents payment service users from taking advantage of services offered by other payment service providers including payment initiation services and account information services furthermore such terms and conditions should not contain any provisions that would make it more difficult in any way to use the payment services of other payment service providers authorised or registered pursuant to this directive 70 in order to reduce the risks and consequences of unauthorised or incorrectly executed payment transactions the payment service user should inform the payment service provider as soon as possible about any contestations concerning allegedly unauthorised or incorrectly executed payment transactions provided that the payment service provider has fulfilled its information obligations under this directive if the notification deadline is met by the payment service user the payment service user should be able to pursue those claims subject to national limitation periods this directive should not affect other claims between payment service users and payment service providers 71 in the case of an unauthorised payment transaction the payment service provider should immediately refund the amount of that transaction to the payer however where there is a high suspicion of an unauthorised transaction resulting from fraudulent behaviour by the payment service user and where that suspicion is based on objective grounds which are communicated to the relevant national authority the payment service provider should be able to conduct within a reasonable time an investigation before refunding the payer in order to protect the payer from any disadvantages the credit value date of the refund should not be later than the date when the amount has been debited in order to provide an incentive for the payment service user to notify without undue delay the payment service provider of any theft or loss of a payment instrument and thus to reduce the risk of unauthorised payment transactions the user should be liable only for a very limited amount unless the payment service user has acted fraudulently or with gross negligence in that context an amount of eur 50 seems to be adequate in order to ensure a harmonised and high-level user protection within the union there should be no liability where the payer is not in a position to become aware of the loss theft or misappropriation of the payment instrument moreover once users have notified a payment service provider that their payment instrument may have been compromised payment service users should not be required to cover any further losses stemming from unauthorised use of that instrument this directive should be without prejudice to payment service providers ’ responsibility for technical security of their own products 72 in order to assess possible negligence or gross negligence on the part of the payment service user account should be taken of all of the circumstances the evidence and degree of alleged negligence should generally be evaluated according to national law however while the concept of negligence implies a breach of a duty of care gross negligence should mean more than mere negligence involving conduct exhibiting a significant degree of carelessness for example keeping the credentials used to authorise a payment transaction beside the payment instrument in a format that is open and easily detectable by third parties contractual terms and conditions relating to the provision and use of a payment instrument the effect of which would be to increase the burden of proof on the consumer or to reduce the burden of proof on the issuer should be considered to be null and void moreover in specific situations and in particular where the payment instrument is not present at the point of sale such as in the case of online payments it is appropriate that the payment service provider be required to provide evidence of alleged negligence since the payer ’ s means to do so are very limited in such cases 73 provision should be made for the allocation of losses in the case of unauthorised payment transactions different provisions may apply to payment service users who are not consumers since such users are normally in a better position to assess the risk of fraud and take countervailing measures in order to ensure a high level of consumer protection payers should always be entitled to address their claim to a refund to their account servicing payment service provider even where a payment initiation service provider is involved in the payment transaction this is without prejudice to the allocation of liability between the payment service providers 74 in the case of payment initiation services rights and obligations of the payment service users and of the payment service providers involved should be appropriate to the service provided specifically the allocation of liability between the payment service provider servicing the account and the payment initiation service provider involved in the transaction should compel them to take responsibility for the respective parts of the transaction that are under their control 75 this directive aims to increase consumer protection in cases of card-based payment transactions where the exact transaction amount is not known at the moment when the payer gives consent to execute the payment transaction for example at automatic fuelling stations in car rental contracts or when making hotel reservations the payer ’ s payment service provider should be able to block funds on the payer ’ s payment account only if the payer has given consent to the exact amount of the funds to be blocked and those funds should be released without undue delay after receipt of the information concerning the exact amount of the payment transaction and at the latest immediately after receipt of the payment order 76 the sepa project aims to further develop common union-wide payment services to replace current national services with regard to payments denominated in euro with a view to ensuring complete migration to union-wide credit transfers and direct debits regulation eu no 260/2012 establishes technical and business requirements for credit transfers and direct debits in euro with reference to direct debits that regulation envisages that the payer give consent both to the payee and to the payer ’ s payment service provider directly or indirectly via the payee and that mandates together with later modifications or cancellation are stored by the payee or by a third party on behalf of the payee the current and so far only pan-european direct debit scheme for consumer payments in euro developed by the european payments council is based on the principle that the mandate to execute a direct debit is given by the payer to the payee and together with later modifications or cancellation is stored by the payee the mandate can also be stored by a third party on behalf of the payee in order to ensure broad public support for sepa and to ensure a high level of consumer protection within sepa the existing pan-european direct debit scheme provides for an unconditional right to a refund for authorised payments reflecting that reality this directive aims to establish an unconditional right to a refund as a general requirement for all euro-denominated direct debit transactions in the union however in parallel with sepa legacy non-euro direct debit schemes continue to exist in member states whose currency is not the euro those schemes are proving to be efficient and ensure the same high level of protection to the payer by other safeguards not always based on an unconditional right to a refund in that case the payer should be protected by the general rule for a refund when the executed payment transaction exceeds the amount which could reasonably have been expected in addition it should be possible for member states to lay down rules concerning the right to a refund that are more favourable to the payer there is a genuine demand for specific euro-denominated direct debit products within sepa as illustrated by the continued existence of certain legacy payment services in euro in some member states it would be proportionate to permit the payer and the payer ’ s payment service provider to agree in a framework contract that the payer has no right to a refund in situations where the payer is protected either because the payer has given consent to execute a transaction directly to its payment service provider including when the payment service provider acts on behalf of the payee or because where applicable information on the future payment transaction was provided or made available in an agreed manner to the payer at least 4 weeks before the due date by the payment service provider or by the payee in any event the payer should always be protected by the general refund rule in the case of unauthorised or incorrectly executed payment transactions 77 for financial planning and the fulfilment of payment obligations in due time consumers and undertakings need to have certainty as to the length of time that the execution of a payment order will take this directive should therefore establish when rights and obligations take effect namely when the payment service provider receives the payment order including when the payment service provider has had the opportunity to receive it through the means of communication agreed in the payment service contract notwithstanding any prior involvement in the process leading up to the creation and transmission of the payment order e.g security and availability of funds checks information on the use of the personal identity number or issuance of a payment promise furthermore receipt of a payment order should occur when the payer ’ s payment service provider receives the payment order to be debited from the payer ’ s account the day or moment when a payee transmits to the payment service provider payment orders for the collection e.g of card payments or of direct debits or when the payee is granted a pre-financing on the related amounts by the payment service provider by way of a contingent credit to the account should have no relevance in that respect users should be able to rely on the proper execution of a complete and valid payment order if the payment service provider has no contractual or statutory ground for refusal if the payment service provider refuses a payment order the refusal and the reason for the refusal should be communicated to the payment service user at the earliest opportunity subject to the requirements of union and national law where the framework contract provides that the payment service provider may charge a fee for refusal such a fee should be objectively justified and should be kept as low as possible 78 in view of the speed with which modern fully automated payment systems process payment transactions which means that after a certain point in time payment orders can not be revoked without high manual intervention costs it is necessary to specify a clear deadline for payment revocations however depending on the type of the payment service and the payment order it should be possible to vary the deadline for payment revocations by agreement between the parties revocation in that context should apply only to the relationship between a payment service user and a payment service provider thus being without prejudice to the irrevocability and finality of payment transactions in payment systems 79 such irrevocability should not affect a payment service provider ’ s rights or obligations under the laws of some member states based on the payer ’ s framework contract or national laws regulations administrative provisions or guidelines to reimburse the payer with the amount of the executed payment transaction in the event of a dispute between the payer and the payee such reimbursement should be considered to be a new payment order except for those cases legal disputes arising within the relationship underlying the payment order should be settled only between the payer and the payee 80 it is essential for the fully integrated straight-through processing of payments and for legal certainty with respect to the fulfilment of any underlying obligation between payment service users that the full amount transferred by the payer should be credited to the account of the payee accordingly it should not be possible for any of the intermediaries involved in the execution of payment transactions to make deductions from the amount transferred however it should be possible for payees to enter into an agreement with their payment service provider which allows the latter to deduct its own charges nevertheless in order to enable the payee to verify that the amount due is correctly paid subsequent information provided on the payment transaction should indicate not only the full amount of funds transferred but also the amount of any charges that have been deducted 81 low-value payment instruments should be a cheap and easy-to-use alternative in the case of low-priced goods and services and should not be overburdened by excessive requirements the relevant information requirements and rules on their execution should therefore be limited to essential information also taking into account the technical capabilities that can justifiably be expected from instruments dedicated to low-value payments despite the lighter regime payment service users should have adequate protection having regard to the limited risks posed by those payment instruments especially with regard to prepaid payment instruments 82 in order to improve the efficiency of payments throughout the union all payment orders initiated by the payer and denominated in euro or the currency of a member state whose currency is not the euro including credit transfers and money remittances should be subject to a maximum 1-day execution time for all other payments such as payments initiated by or through a payee including direct debits and card payments in the absence of an explicit agreement between the payment service provider and the payer setting a longer execution time the same 1-day execution time should apply it should be possible to extend those periods by 1 additional business day if a payment order is given on paper to allow the continued provision of payment services to consumers who are used only to paper documents when a direct debit scheme is used the payee ’ s payment service provider should transmit the collection order within the time limits agreed between the payee and the payment service provider enabling settlement on the agreed due date in view of the fact that payment infrastructures are often highly efficient and in order to prevent any deterioration in current service levels member states should be allowed to maintain or establish rules specifying an execution time shorter than 1 business day where appropriate 83 the provisions on execution for the full amount and execution time should constitute good practice where one of the payment service providers is not located in the union 84 in order to strengthen the trust of consumers in a harmonised payment market it is essential for payment service users to know the real costs and charges of payment services in order to make their choice accordingly the use of non-transparent pricing methods should be prohibited since it is commonly accepted that those methods make it extremely difficult for users to establish the real price of the payment service specifically the use of value dating to the disadvantage of the user should not be permitted 85 the smooth and efficient functioning of the payment system depends on the user being able to rely on the payment service provider executing the payment transaction correctly and within the agreed time usually the payment service provider is in a position to assess the risks involved in the payment transaction it is the payment service provider that provides the payments system makes arrangements to recall misplaced or wrongly allocated funds and decides in most cases on the intermediaries involved in the execution of a payment transaction in view of all of those considerations it is appropriate except under abnormal and unforeseeable circumstances to impose liability on the payment service provider in respect of the execution of a payment transaction accepted from the user except in respect of acts and omissions by the payee ’ s payment service provider who was selected solely by the payee however in order not to leave the payer unprotected in the unlikely circumstances that it is not clear that the payment amount was duly received by the payee ’ s payment service provider the corresponding burden of proof should lie on the payer ’ s payment service provider as a rule it can be expected that the intermediary institution usually a neutral body such as a central bank or a clearing house that transfers the payment amount from the sending to the receiving payment service provider will store the account data and will be able to provide the latter where necessary where the payment amount has been credited to the receiving payment service provider ’ s account the payee should immediately have a claim against the payment service provider for credit to the account 86 the payer ’ s payment service provider namely the account servicing payment service provider or where appropriate the payment initiation service provider should assume liability for correct payment execution including in particular the full amount of the payment transaction and execution time and full responsibility for any failure by other parties in the payment chain up to the account of the payee as a result of that liability the payment service provider of the payer should where the full amount is not credited or is only credited late to the payee ’ s payment service provider correct the payment transaction or without undue delay refund the payer the relevant amount of that transaction without prejudice to any other claims which may be made in accordance with national law due to the payment service provider ’ s liability the payer or payee should not be burdened with any costs relating to the incorrect payment in the case of non-execution defective or late execution of payment transactions member states should ensure that the value date of corrective payments of payment service providers is always the same as the value date in the case of correct execution 87 this directive should concern only contractual obligations and responsibilities between the payment service user and the payment service provider however the proper functioning of credit transfers and other payment services requires that payment service providers and their intermediaries such as processors have contracts in which their mutual rights and obligations are laid down questions relating to liabilities form an essential part of those uniform contracts to ensure the reliability among payment service providers and intermediaries taking part in a payment transaction legal certainty is necessary to the effect that a non-responsible payment service provider is compensated for losses incurred or sums paid pursuant to the provisions of this directive relating to liability further rights and details of content of recourse and how to handle claims towards the payment service provider or intermediary attributable to a defective payment transaction should be subject to agreement 88 it should be possible for the payment service provider to specify unambiguously the information required to execute a payment order correctly on the other hand however in order to avoid fragmentation and jeopardising the setting-up of integrated payment systems in the union member states should not be allowed to require a particular identifier to be used for payment transactions however that should not prevent member states from requiring the payment service provider of the payer to act with due diligence and to verify where technically possible and without requiring manual intervention the coherence of the unique identifier and where the unique identifier is found to be incoherent to refuse the payment order and inform the payer thereof the liability of the payment service provider should be limited to the correct execution of the payment transaction in accordance with the payment order of the payment service user if the funds involved in a payment transaction reach the wrong recipient due to an incorrect unique identifier provided by the payer the payment service providers of the payer and the payee should not be liable but should be obliged to cooperate in making reasonable efforts to recover the funds including by communicating relevant information 89 provision of payment services by the payment services providers may entail processing of personal data directive 95/46/ec of the european parliament and of the council 22 the national rules which transpose directive 95/46/ec and regulation ec no 45/2001 of the european parliament and of the council 23 are applicable to the processing of personal data for the purposes of this directive in particular where personal data is processed for the purposes of this directive the precise purpose should be specified the relevant legal basis referred to the relevant security requirements laid down in directive 95/46/ec complied with and the principles of necessity proportionality purpose limitation and proportionate data retention period respected also data protection by design and data protection by default should be embedded in all data processing systems developed and used within the framework of this directive 90 this directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the charter of fundamental rights of the european union including the right to respect for private and family life the right to protection of personal data the freedom to conduct a business the right to an effective remedy and the right not to be tried or punished twice in criminal proceedings for the same offence this directive must be implemented in accordance with those rights and principles 91 payment service providers are responsible for security measures those measures need to be proportionate to the security risks concerned payment service providers should establish a framework to mitigate risks and maintain effective incident management procedures a regular reporting mechanism should be established to ensure that payment service providers provide the competent authorities on a regular basis with an updated assessment of their security risks and the measures that they have taken in response to those risks furthermore in order to ensure that damage to users other payment service providers or payment systems such as a substantial disruption of a payment system is kept to a minimum it is essential that payment service providers be required to report major security incidents without undue delay to the competent authorities a coordination role by eba should be established 92 the security incidents reporting obligations should be without prejudice to other incident reporting obligations laid down in other legal acts of the union and any requirements laid down in this directive should be aligned with and proportionate to the reporting obligations imposed by other union law 93 it is necessary to set up a clear legal framework which sets out the conditions under which payment initiation service providers and account information service providers can provide their services with the consent of the account holder without being required by the account servicing payment service provider to use a particular business model whether based on direct or indirect access for the provision of those types of services the payment initiation service providers and the account information service providers on the one hand and the account servicing payment service provider on the other should observe the necessary data protection and security requirements established by or referred to in this directive or included in the regulatory technical standards those regulatory technical standards should be compatible with the different technological solutions available in order to ensure secure communication between the relevant actors in the context of those services eba should also specify the requirements of common and open standards of communication to be implemented by all account servicing payment service providers that allow for the provision of online payment services this means that those open standards should ensure the interoperability of different technological communication solutions those common and open standards should also ensure that the account servicing payment service provider is aware that he is being contacted by a payment initiation service provider or an account information service provider and not by the client itself the standards should also ensure that payment initiation service providers and account information service providers communicate with the account servicing payment service provider and with the customers involved in a secure manner in developing those requirements eba should pay particular attention to the fact that the standards to be applied are to allow for the use of all common types of devices such as computers tablets and mobile phones for carrying out different payment services 94 when developing regulatory technical standards on authentication and communication eba should systematically assess and take into account the privacy dimension in order to identify the risks associated with each of the technical options available and the remedies that could be put in place to minimise threats to data protection 95 security of electronic payments is fundamental for ensuring the protection of users and the development of a sound environment for e-commerce all payment services offered electronically should be carried out in a secure manner adopting technologies able to guarantee the safe authentication of the user and to reduce to the maximum extent possible the risk of fraud there does not seem to be a need to guarantee the same level of protection to payment transactions initiated and executed with modalities other than the use of electronic platforms or devices such as paper-based payment transactions mail orders or telephone orders a solid growth of internet payments and mobile payments should be accompanied by a generalised enhancement of security measures payment services offered via internet or via other at-distance channels the functioning of which does not depend on where the device used to initiate the payment transaction or the payment instrument used are physically located should therefore include the authentication of transactions through dynamic codes in order to make the user aware at all times of the amount and the payee of the transaction that the user is authorising 96 the security measures should be compatible with the level of risk involved in the payment service in order to allow the development of user-friendly and accessible means of payment for low-risk payments such as low value contactless payments at the point of sale whether or not they are based on mobile phone the exemptions to the application of security requirements should be specified in regulatory technical standards safe use of personalised security credentials is needed to limit the risks relating to phishing and other fraudulent activities in that respect the user should be able to rely on the adoption of measures that protect the confidentiality and integrity of personalised security credentials those measures typically include encryption systems based on personal devices of the payer including card readers or mobile phones or provided to the payer by its account servicing payment service provider via a different channel such as by sms or email the measures typically including encryption systems which may result in authentication codes such as one-time passwords are able to enhance the security of payment transactions the use of such authentication codes by payment service users should be considered to be compatible with their obligations in relation to payment instruments and personalised security credentials also when payment initiation service providers or account information service providers are involved 97 member states should determine whether the competent authorities designated for granting authorisation to payment institutions might also be the competent authorities with regard to alternative dispute resolution adr procedures 98 without prejudice to the right of customers to bring action in the courts member states should ensure easily accessible adequate independent impartial transparent and effective adr procedure between payment service providers and payment service users arising from the rights and obligations set out in this directive regulation ec no 593/2008 of the european parliament and of the council 24 provides that the protection afforded to consumers by the mandatory rules of the law of the country in which they have their habitual residence is not to be undermined by any contractual terms concerning the law applicable to the contract with a view to establishing an efficient and effective dispute resolution procedure member states should ensure that payment service providers put in place an effective complaints procedure that can be followed by their payment service users before the dispute is referred to be resolved in an adr procedure or before a court the complaints procedure should contain short and clearly defined timeframes within which the payment service provider should reply to a complaint member states should ensure that adr entities have sufficient capacity to engage in an adequate and efficient way in cross-border cooperation with regard to disputes concerning rights and obligations pursuant to this directive 99 it is necessary to ensure the effective enforcement of the provisions of national law adopted pursuant to this directive appropriate procedures should therefore be established by means of which it will be possible to pursue complaints against payment service providers which do not comply with those provisions and to ensure that where appropriate effective proportionate and dissuasive penalties are imposed in view of ensuring effective compliance with this directive member states should designate competent authorities which meet the conditions laid down in regulation eu no 1093/2010 and which act independently from the payment service providers for reasons of transparency member states should notify the commission which authorities have been designated with a clear description of their duties pursuant to this directive 100 without prejudice to the right to bring action in the courts to ensure compliance with this directive member states should also ensure that competent authorities are granted the necessary power including the power to impose penalties where the payment service provider does not comply with the rights and obligations laid down in this directive in particular if there is a risk of re-offending or another concern for collective consumer interests 101 it is important that consumers be informed in a clear and comprehensible way of their rights and obligations under this directive the commission should therefore produce a leaflet about those rights and obligations 102 this directive is without prejudice to provisions of national law relating to the consequences as regards liability of inaccuracy in the expression or transmission of a statement 103 this directive should be without prejudice to the provisions relating to the vat treatment of payment services in council directive 2006/112/ec 25 104 where this directive makes reference to amounts in euro these amounts have to be intended as the national currency equivalent as determined by each non-euro member state 105 in the interests of legal certainty it is appropriate to make transitional arrangements allowing persons who have commenced the activities of payment institutions in accordance with the national law transposing directive 2007/64/ec before the entry into force of this directive to continue those activities within the member state concerned for a specified period 106 the power to adopt acts in accordance with article 290 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union should be delegated to the commission in respect of adapting the reference to recommendation 2003/361/ec where that recommendation is amended and updating the average amount of payment transactions executed by the payment service provider used as a threshold for member states that apply the option to exempt parts of the authorisation requirements for smaller payment institutions to take account of inflation it is of particular importance that the commission carries out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work including at expert level the commission when preparing and drawing up delegated acts should ensure a simultaneous timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the european parliament and to the council 107 in order to ensure consistent application of this directive the commission should be able to rely on the expertise and support of eba which should have the task of elaborating guidelines and preparing draft regulatory technical standards on security aspects of payment services in particular with regard to strong customer authentication and on cooperation between member states in the context of the provision of services and establishment of authorised payment institutions in other member states the commission should be empowered to adopt those draft regulatory technical standards those specific tasks are fully in line with the role and responsibilities of eba as provided in regulation eu no 1093/2010 108 eba should when developing guidelines draft regulatory technical standards and draft implementing technical standards pursuant to this directive and in accordance with regulation eu no 1093/2010 ensure that it consults all relevant stakeholders including those in the payment services market reflecting all interests involved if necessary for getting a proper balance of views eba should make a particular effort to obtain the views of relevant non-bank actors 109 since the objective of this directive namely the further integration of an internal market in payment services can not be sufficiently achieved by the member states because it requires the harmonisation of a multitude of different rules currently existing in the legal systems of the various member states but can rather because of its scale and effects be better achieved at union level the union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in article 5 of the treaty on european union in accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that article this directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective 110 in accordance with the joint political declaration of 28 september 2011 of member states and the commission on explanatory documents 26 member states have undertaken to accompany in justified cases the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments with regard to this directive the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified 111 the european data protection supervisor was consulted in accordance with article 28 2 of regulation ec no 45/2001 and delivered an opinion on 5 december 2013 27 112 directives 2002/65/ec 2009/110/ec and 2013/36/eu and regulation eu no 1093/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly 113 given the number of changes that need to be made to directive 2007/64/ec it is appropriate to repeal and replace it have adopted this directive title i subject matter scope and definitions article 1 subject matter 1. this directive establishes the rules in accordance with which member states shall distinguish between the following categories of payment service provider a credit institutions as defined in point 1 of article 4 1 of regulation eu no 575/2013 of the european parliament and of the council 28 including branches thereof within the meaning of point 17 article 4 1 of that regulation where such branches are located in the union whether the head offices of those branches are located within the union or in accordance with article 47 of directive 2013/36/eu and with national law outside the union b electronic money institutions within the meaning of point 1 of article 2 of directive 2009/110/ec including in accordance with article 8 of that directive and with national law branches thereof where such branches are located

institutions which are entitled under national law to provide payment services d payment institutions e the ecb and national central banks when not acting in their capacity as monetary authority or other public authorities f member states or their regional or local authorities when not acting in their capacity as public authorities 2. this directive also establishes rules concerning a the transparency of conditions and information requirements for payment services and b the respective rights and obligations of payment service users and payment service providers in relation to the provision of payment services as a regular occupation or business activity article 2 scope 1. this directive applies to payment services provided within the union 2. titles iii and iv apply to payment transactions in the currency of a member state where both the payer ’ s payment service provider and the payee ’ s payment service provider are or the sole payment service provider in the payment

where only one of the payment service providers is located within the union in respect to those parts of the payments transaction which are carried out in the union 5. member states may exempt institutions referred to in points 4 to 23 of article 2 5 of directive 2013/36/eu from the application of all or part of the provisions of this directive article 3 exclusions this directive does not apply to the following a payment transactions made exclusively in cash directly from the payer to the payee without any intermediary intervention b payment transactions from the payer to the payee

32016R0679	l_2016119en.01000101.xml 4.5.2016 en official journal of the european union l 119/1 regulation eu 2016/679 of the european parliament and of the council of 27 april 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and repealing directive 95/46/ec general data protection regulation text with eea relevance the european parliament and the council of the european union having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the european union and in particular article 16 thereof having regard to the proposal from the european commission after transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments having regard to the opinion of the european economic and social committee 1 having regard to the opinion of the committee of the regions 2 acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 3 whereas 1 the protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data is a fundamental right article 8 1 of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union the ‘ charter ’ and article 16 1 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union tfeu provide that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her 2 the principles of and rules on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data should whatever their nationality or residence respect their fundamental rights and freedoms in particular their right to the protection of personal data this regulation is intended to contribute to the accomplishment of an area of freedom security and justice and of an economic union to economic and social progress to the strengthening and the convergence of the economies within the internal market and to the well-being of natural persons 3 directive 95/46/ec of the european parliament and of the council 4 seeks to harmonise the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in respect of processing activities and to ensure the free flow of personal data between member states 4 the processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind the right to the protection of personal data is not an absolute right it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other fundamental rights in accordance with the principle of proportionality this regulation respects all fundamental rights and observes the freedoms and principles recognised in the charter as enshrined in the treaties in particular the respect for private and family life home and communications the protection of personal data freedom of thought conscience and religion freedom of expression and information freedom to conduct a business the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial and cultural religious and linguistic diversity 5 the economic and social integration resulting from the functioning of the internal market has led to a substantial increase in cross-border flows of personal data the exchange of personal data between public and private actors including natural persons associations and undertakings across the union has increased national authorities in the member states are being called upon by union law to cooperate and exchange personal data so as to be able to perform their duties or carry out tasks on behalf of an authority in another member state 6 rapid technological developments and globalisation have brought new challenges for the protection of personal data the scale of the collection and sharing of personal data has increased significantly technology allows both private companies and public authorities to make use of personal data on an unprecedented scale in order to pursue their activities natural persons increasingly make personal information available publicly and globally technology has transformed both the economy and social life and should further facilitate the free flow of personal data within the union and the transfer to third countries and international organisations while ensuring a high level of the protection of personal data 7 those developments require a strong and more coherent data protection framework in the union backed by strong enforcement given the importance of creating the trust that will allow the digital economy to develop across the internal market natural persons should have control of their own personal data legal and practical certainty for natural persons economic operators and public authorities should be enhanced 8 where this regulation provides for specifications or restrictions of its rules by member state law member states may as far as necessary for coherence and for making the national provisions comprehensible to the persons to whom they apply incorporate elements of this regulation into their national law 9 the objectives and principles of directive 95/46/ec remain sound but it has not prevented fragmentation in the implementation of data protection across the union legal uncertainty or a widespread public perception that there are significant risks to the protection of natural persons in particular with regard to online activity differences in the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons in particular the right to the protection of personal data with regard to the processing of personal data in the member states may prevent the free flow of personal data throughout the union those differences may therefore constitute an obstacle to the pursuit of economic activities at the level of the union distort competition and impede authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities under union law such a difference in levels of protection is due to the existence of differences in the implementation and application of directive 95/46/ec 10 in order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons and to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data within the union the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all member states consistent and homogenous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data should be ensured throughout the union regarding the processing of personal data for compliance with a legal obligation for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller member states should be allowed to maintain or introduce national provisions to further specify the application of the rules of this regulation in conjunction with the general and horizontal law on data protection implementing directive 95/46/ec member states have several sector-specific laws in areas that need more specific provisions this regulation also provides a margin of manoeuvre for member states to specify its rules including for the processing of special categories of personal data ‘ sensitive data ’ to that extent this regulation does not exclude member state law that sets out the circumstances for specific processing situations including determining more precisely the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful 11 effective protection of personal data throughout the union requires the strengthening and setting out in detail of the rights of data subjects and the obligations of those who process and determine the processing of personal data as well as equivalent powers for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the rules for the protection of personal data and equivalent sanctions for infringements in the member states 12 article 16 2 tfeu mandates the european parliament and the council to lay down the rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the rules relating to the free movement of personal data 13 in order to ensure a consistent level of protection for natural persons throughout the union and to prevent divergences hampering the free movement of personal data within the internal market a regulation is necessary to provide legal certainty and transparency for economic operators including micro small and medium-sized enterprises and to provide natural persons in all member states with the same level of legally enforceable rights and obligations and responsibilities for controllers and processors to ensure consistent monitoring of the processing of personal data and equivalent sanctions in all member states as well as effective cooperation between the supervisory authorities of different member states the proper functioning of the internal market requires that the free movement of personal data within the union is not restricted or prohibited for reasons connected with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data to take account of the specific situation of micro small and medium-sized enterprises this regulation includes a derogation for organisations with fewer than 250 employees with regard to record-keeping in addition the union institutions and bodies and member states and their supervisory authorities are encouraged to take account of the specific needs of micro small and medium-sized enterprises in the application of this regulation the notion of micro small and medium-sized enterprises should draw from article 2 of the annex to commission recommendation 2003/361/ec 5 14 the protection afforded by this regulation should apply to natural persons whatever their nationality or place of residence in relation to the processing of their personal data this regulation does not cover the processing of personal data which concerns legal persons and in particular undertakings established as legal persons including the name and the form of the legal person and the contact details of the legal person 15 in order to prevent creating a serious risk of circumvention the protection of natural persons should be technologically neutral and should not depend on the techniques used the protection of natural persons should apply to the processing of personal data by automated means as well as to manual processing if the personal data are contained or are intended to be contained in a filing system files or sets of files as well as their cover pages which are not structured according to specific criteria should not fall within the scope of this regulation 16 this regulation does not apply to issues of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms or the free flow of personal data related to activities which fall outside the scope of union law such as activities concerning national security this regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by the member states when carrying out activities in relation to the common foreign and security policy of the union 17 regulation ec no 45/2001 of the european parliament and of the council 6 applies to the processing of personal data by the union institutions bodies offices and agencies regulation ec no 45/2001 and other union legal acts applicable to such processing of personal data should be adapted to the principles and rules established in this regulation and applied in the light of this regulation in order to provide a strong and coherent data protection framework in the union the necessary adaptations of regulation ec no 45/2001 should follow after the adoption of this regulation in order to allow application at the same time as this regulation 18 this regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity and thus with no connection to a professional or commercial activity personal or household activities could include correspondence and the holding of addresses or social networking and online activity undertaken within the context of such activities however this regulation applies to controllers or processors which provide the means for processing personal data for such personal or household activities 19 the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention investigation detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security and the free movement of such data is the subject of a specific union legal act this regulation should not therefore apply to processing activities for those purposes however personal data processed by public authorities under this regulation should when used for those purposes be governed by a more specific union legal act namely directive eu 2016/680 of the european parliament and of the council 7 member states may entrust competent authorities within the meaning of directive eu 2016/680 with tasks which are not necessarily carried out for the purposes of the prevention investigation detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties including the safeguarding against and prevention of threats to public security so that the processing of personal data for those other purposes in so far as it is within the scope of union law falls within the scope of this regulation with regard to the processing of personal data by those competent authorities for purposes falling within scope of this regulation member states should be able to maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this regulation such provisions may determine more precisely specific requirements for the processing of personal data by those competent authorities for those other purposes taking into account the constitutional organisational and administrative structure of the respective member state when the processing of personal data by private bodies falls within the scope of this regulation this regulation should provide for the possibility for member states under specific conditions to restrict by law certain obligations and rights when such a restriction constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard specific important interests including public security and the prevention investigation detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security this is relevant for instance in the framework of anti-money laundering or the activities of forensic laboratories 20 while this regulation applies inter alia to the activities of courts and other judicial authorities union or member state law could specify the processing operations and processing procedures in relation to the processing of personal data by courts and other judicial authorities the competence of the supervisory authorities should not cover the processing of personal data when courts are acting in their judicial capacity in order to safeguard the independence of the judiciary in the performance of its judicial tasks including decision-making it should be possible to entrust supervision of such data processing operations to specific bodies within the judicial system of the member state which should in particular ensure compliance with the rules of this regulation enhance awareness among members of the judiciary of their obligations under this regulation and handle complaints in relation to such data processing operations 21 this regulation is without prejudice to the application of directive 2000/31/ec of the european parliament and of the council 8 in particular of the liability rules of intermediary service providers in articles 12 to 15 of that directive that directive seeks to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market by ensuring the free movement of information society services between member states 22 any processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the union should be carried out in accordance with this regulation regardless of whether the processing itself takes place within the union establishment implies the effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements the legal form of such arrangements whether through a branch or a subsidiary with a legal personality is not the determining factor in that respect 23 in order to ensure that natural persons are not deprived of the protection to which they are entitled under this regulation the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the union by a controller or a processor not established in the union should be subject to this regulation where the processing activities are related to offering goods or services to such data subjects irrespective of whether connected to a payment in order to determine whether such a controller or processor is offering goods or services to data subjects who are in the union it should be ascertained whether it is apparent that the controller or processor envisages offering services to data subjects in one or more member states in the union whereas the mere accessibility of the controller 's processor 's or an intermediary 's website in the union of an email address or of other contact details or the use of a language generally used in the third country where the controller is established is insufficient to ascertain such intention factors such as the use of a language or a currency generally used in one or more member states with the possibility of ordering goods and services in that other language or the mentioning of customers or users who are in the union may make it apparent that the controller envisages offering goods or services to data subjects in the union 24 the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the union by a controller or processor not established in the union should also be subject to this regulation when it is related to the monitoring of the behaviour of such data subjects in so far as their behaviour takes place within the union in order to determine whether a processing activity can be considered to monitor the behaviour of data subjects it should be ascertained whether natural persons are tracked on the internet including potential subsequent use of personal data processing techniques which consist of profiling a natural person particularly in order to take decisions concerning her or him or for analysing or predicting her or his personal preferences behaviours and attitudes 25 where member state law applies by virtue of public international law this regulation should also apply to a controller not established in the union such as in a member state 's diplomatic mission or consular post 26 the principles of data protection should apply to any information concerning an identified or identifiable natural person personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person to determine whether a natural person is identifiable account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used such as singling out either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly to ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person account should be taken of all objective factors such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments the principles of data protection should therefore not apply to anonymous information namely information which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable this regulation does not therefore concern the processing of such anonymous information including for statistical or research purposes 27 this regulation does not apply to the personal data of deceased persons member states may provide for rules regarding the processing of personal data of deceased persons 28 the application of pseudonymisation to personal data can reduce the risks to the data subjects concerned and help controllers and processors to meet their data-protection obligations the explicit introduction of ‘ pseudonymisation ’ in this regulation is not intended to preclude any other measures of data protection 29 in order to create incentives to apply pseudonymisation when processing personal data measures of pseudonymisation should whilst allowing general analysis be possible within the same controller when that controller has taken technical and organisational measures necessary to ensure for the processing concerned that this regulation is implemented and that additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject is kept separately the controller processing the personal data should indicate the authorised persons within the same controller 30 natural persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices applications tools and protocols such as internet protocol addresses cookie identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification tags this may leave traces which in particular when combined with unique identifiers and other information received by the servers may be used to create profiles of the natural persons and identify them 31 public authorities to which personal data are disclosed in accordance with a legal obligation for the exercise of their official mission such as tax and customs authorities financial investigation units independent administrative authorities or financial market authorities responsible for the regulation and supervision of securities markets should not be regarded as recipients if they receive personal data which are necessary to carry out a particular inquiry in the general interest in accordance with union or member state law the requests for disclosure sent by the public authorities should always be in writing reasoned and occasional and should not concern the entirety of a filing system or lead to the interconnection of filing systems the processing of personal data by those public authorities should comply with the applicable data-protection rules according to the purposes of the processing 32 consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given specific informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject 's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her such as by a written statement including by electronic means or an oral statement this could include ticking a box when visiting an internet website choosing technical settings for information society services or another statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject 's acceptance of the proposed processing of his or her personal data silence pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent consent should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes when the processing has multiple purposes consent should be given for all of them if the data subject 's consent is to be given following a request by electronic means the request must be clear concise and not unnecessarily disruptive to the use of the service for which it is provided 33 it is often not possible to fully identify the purpose of personal data processing for scientific research purposes at the time of data collection therefore data subjects should be allowed to give their consent to certain areas of scientific research when in keeping with recognised ethical standards for scientific research data subjects should have the opportunity to give their consent only to certain areas of research or parts of research projects to the extent allowed by the intended purpose 34 genetic data should be defined as personal data relating to the inherited or acquired genetic characteristics of a natural person which result from the analysis of a biological sample from the natural person in question in particular chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid dna or ribonucleic acid rna analysis or from the analysis of another element enabling equivalent information to be obtained 35 personal data concerning health should include all data pertaining to the health status of a data subject which reveal information relating to the past current or future physical or mental health status of the data subject this includes information about the natural person collected in the course of the registration for or the provision of health care services as referred to in directive 2011/24/eu of the european parliament and of the council 9 to that natural person a number symbol or particular assigned to a natural person to uniquely identify the natural person for health purposes information derived from the testing or examination of a body part or bodily substance including from genetic data and biological samples and any information on for example a disease disability disease risk medical history clinical treatment or the physiological or biomedical state of the data subject independent of its source for example from a physician or other health professional a hospital a medical device or an in vitro diagnostic test 36 the main establishment of a controller in the union should be the place of its central administration in the union unless the decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken in another establishment of the controller in the union in which case that other establishment should be considered to be the main establishment the main establishment of a controller in the union should be determined according to objective criteria and should imply the effective and real exercise of management activities determining the main decisions as to the purposes and means of processing through stable arrangements that criterion should not depend on whether the processing of personal data is carried out at that location the presence and use of technical means and technologies for processing personal data or processing activities do not in themselves constitute a main establishment and are therefore not determining criteria for a main establishment the main establishment of the processor should be the place of its central administration in the union or if it has no central administration in the union the place where the main processing activities take place in the union in cases involving both the controller and the processor the competent lead supervisory authority should remain the supervisory authority of the member state where the controller has its main establishment but the supervisory authority of the processor should be considered to be a supervisory authority concerned and that supervisory authority should participate in the cooperation procedure provided for by this regulation in any case the supervisory authorities of the member state or member states where the processor has one or more establishments should not be considered to be supervisory authorities concerned where the draft decision concerns only the controller where the processing is carried out by a group of undertakings the main establishment of the controlling undertaking should be considered to be the main establishment of the group of undertakings except where the purposes and means of processing are determined by another undertaking 37 a group of undertakings should cover a controlling undertaking and its controlled undertakings whereby the controlling undertaking should be the undertaking which can exert a dominant influence over the other undertakings by virtue for example of ownership financial participation or the rules which govern it or the power to have personal data protection rules implemented an undertaking which controls the processing of personal data in undertakings affiliated to it should be regarded together with those undertakings as a group of undertakings 38 children merit specific protection with regard to their personal data as they may be less aware of the risks consequences and safeguards concerned and their rights in relation to the processing of personal data such specific protection should in particular apply to the use of personal data of children for the purposes of marketing or creating personality or user profiles and the collection of personal data with regard to children when using services offered directly to a child the consent of the holder of parental responsibility should not be necessary in the context of preventive or counselling services offered directly to a child 39 any processing of personal data should be lawful and fair it should be transparent to natural persons that personal data concerning them are collected used consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be processed the principle of transparency requires that any information and communication relating to the processing of those personal data be easily accessible and easy to understand and that clear and plain language be used that principle concerns in particular information to the data subjects on the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing and further information to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the natural persons concerned and their right to obtain confirmation and communication of personal data concerning them which are being processed natural persons should be made aware of risks rules safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data and how to exercise their rights in relation to such processing in particular the specific purposes for which personal data are processed should be explicit and legitimate and determined at the time of the collection of the personal data the personal data should be adequate relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed this requires in particular ensuring that the period for which the personal data are stored is limited to a strict minimum personal data should be processed only if the purpose of the processing could not reasonably be fulfilled by other means in order to ensure that the personal data are not kept longer than necessary time limits should be established by the controller for erasure or for a periodic review every reasonable step should be taken to ensure that personal data which are inaccurate are rectified or deleted personal data should be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality of the personal data including for preventing unauthorised access to or use of personal data and the equipment used for the processing 40 in order for processing to be lawful personal data should be processed on the basis of the consent of the data subject concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law either in this regulation or in other union or member state law as referred to in this regulation including the necessity for compliance with the legal obligation to which the controller is subject or the necessity for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract 41 where this regulation refers to a legal basis or a legislative measure this does not necessarily require a legislative act adopted by a parliament without prejudice to requirements pursuant to the constitutional order of the member state concerned however such a legal basis or legislative measure should be clear and precise and its application should be foreseeable to persons subject to it in accordance with the case-law of the court of justice of the european union the ‘ court of justice ’ and the european court of human rights 42 where processing is based on the data subject 's consent the controller should be able to demonstrate that the data subject has given consent to the processing operation in particular in the context of a written declaration on another matter safeguards should ensure that the data subject is aware of the fact that and the extent to which consent is given in accordance with council directive 93/13/eec 10 a declaration of consent pre-formulated by the controller should be provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form using clear and plain language and it should not contain unfair terms for consent to be informed the data subject should be aware at least of the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended consent should not be regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine or free choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment 43 in order to ensure that consent is freely given consent should not provide a valid legal ground for the processing of personal data in a specific case where there is a clear imbalance between the data subject and the controller in particular where the controller is a public authority and it is therefore unlikely that consent was freely given in all the circumstances of that specific situation consent is presumed not to be freely given if it does not allow separate consent to be given to different personal data processing operations despite it being appropriate in the individual case or if the performance of a contract including the provision of a service is dependent on the consent despite such consent not being necessary for such performance 44 processing should be lawful where it is necessary in the context of a contract or the intention to enter into a contract 45 where processing is carried out in accordance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority the processing should have a basis in union or member state law this regulation does not require a specific law for each individual processing a law as a basis for several processing operations based on a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of an official authority may be sufficient it should also be for union or member state law to determine the purpose of processing furthermore that law could specify the general conditions of this regulation governing the lawfulness of personal data processing establish specifications for determining the controller the type of personal data which are subject to the processing the data subjects concerned the entities to which the personal data may be disclosed the purpose limitations the storage period and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing it should also be for union or member state law to determine whether the controller performing a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority should be a public authority or another natural or legal person governed by public law or where it is in the public interest to do so including for health purposes such as public health and social protection and the management of health care services by private law such as a professional association 46 the processing of personal data should also be regarded to be lawful where it is necessary to protect an interest which is essential for the life of the data subject or that of another natural person processing of personal data based on the vital interest of another natural person should in principle take place only where the processing can not be manifestly based on another legal basis some types of processing may serve both important grounds of public interest and the vital interests of the data subject as for instance when processing is necessary for humanitarian purposes including for monitoring epidemics and their spread or in situations of humanitarian emergencies in particular in situations of natural and man-made disasters 47 the legitimate interests of a controller including those of a controller to which the personal data may be disclosed or of a third party may provide a legal basis for processing provided that the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overriding taking into consideration the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller such legitimate interest could exist for example where there is a relevant and appropriate relationship between the data subject and the controller in situations such as where the data subject is a client or in the service of the controller at any rate the existence of a legitimate interest would need careful assessment including whether a data subject can reasonably expect at the time and in the context of the collection of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject could in particular override the interest of the data controller where personal data are processed in circumstances where data subjects do not reasonably expect further processing given that it is for the legislator to provide by law for the legal basis for public authorities to process personal data that legal basis should not apply to the processing by public authorities in the performance of their tasks the processing of personal data strictly necessary for the purposes of preventing fraud also constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest 48 controllers that are part of a group of undertakings or institutions affiliated to a central body may have a legitimate interest in transmitting personal data within the group of undertakings for internal administrative purposes including the processing of clients or employees personal data the general principles for the transfer of personal data within a group of undertakings to an undertaking located in a third country remain unaffected 49 the processing of personal data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring network and information security i.e the ability of a network or an information system to resist at a given level of confidence accidental events or unlawful or malicious actions that compromise the availability authenticity integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted personal data and the security of the related services offered by or accessible via those networks and systems by public authorities by computer emergency response teams certs computer security incident response teams csirts by providers of electronic communications networks and services and by providers of security technologies and services constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned this could for example include preventing unauthorised access to electronic communications networks and malicious code distribution and stopping ‘ denial of service ’ attacks and damage to computer and electronic communication systems 50 the processing of personal data for purposes other than those for which the personal data were initially collected should be allowed only where the processing is compatible with the purposes for which the personal data were initially collected in such a case no legal basis separate from that which allowed the collection of the personal data is required if the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller union or member state law may determine and specify the tasks and purposes for which the further processing should be regarded as compatible and lawful further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes should be considered to be compatible lawful processing operations the legal basis provided by union or member state law for the processing of personal data may also provide a legal basis for further processing in order to ascertain whether a purpose of further processing is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected the controller after having met all the requirements for the lawfulness of the original processing should take into account inter alia any link between those purposes and the purposes of the intended further processing the context in which the personal data have been collected in particular the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller as to their further use the nature of the personal data the consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects and the existence of appropriate safeguards in both the original and intended further processing operations where the data subject has given consent or the processing is based on union or member state law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard in particular important objectives of general public interest the controller should be allowed to further process the personal data irrespective of the compatibility of the purposes in any case the application of the principles set out in this regulation and in particular the information of the data subject on those other purposes and on his or her rights including the right to object should be ensured indicating possible criminal acts or threats to public security by the controller and transmitting the relevant personal data in individual cases or in several cases relating to the same criminal act or threats to public security to a competent authority should be regarded as being in the legitimate interest pursued by the controller however such transmission in the legitimate interest of the controller or further processing of personal data should be prohibited if the processing is not compatible with a legal professional or other binding obligation of secrecy 51 personal data which are by their nature particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental rights and freedoms merit specific protection as the context of their processing could create significant risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms those personal data should include personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin whereby the use of the term ‘ racial origin ’ in this regulation does not imply an acceptance by the union of theories which attempt to determine the existence of separate human races the processing of photographs should not systematically be considered to be processing of special categories of personal data as they are covered by the definition of biometric data only when processed through a specific technical means allowing the unique identification or authentication of a natural person such personal data should not be processed unless processing is allowed in specific cases set out in this regulation taking into account that member states law may lay down specific provisions on data protection in order to adapt the application of the rules of this regulation for compliance with a legal obligation or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller in addition to the specific requirements for such processing the general principles and other rules of this regulation should apply in particular as regards the conditions for lawful processing derogations from the general prohibition for processing such special categories of personal data should be explicitly provided inter alia where the data subject gives his or her explicit consent or in respect of specific needs in particular where the processing is carried out in the course of legitimate activities by certain associations or foundations the purpose of which is to permit the exercise of fundamental freedoms 52 derogating from the prohibition on processing special categories of personal data should also be allowed when provided for in union or member state law and subject to suitable safeguards so as to protect personal data and other fundamental rights where it is in the public interest to do so in particular processing personal data in the field of employment law social protection law including pensions and for health security monitoring and alert purposes the prevention or control of communicable diseases and other serious threats to health such a derogation may be made for health purposes including public health and the management of health-care services especially in order to ensure the quality and cost-effectiveness of the procedures used for settling claims for benefits and services in the health insurance system or for archiving purposes in the public interest scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes a derogation should also allow the processing of such personal data where necessary for the establishment exercise or defence of legal claims whether in court proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure 53 special categories of personal data which merit higher protection should be processed for health-related purposes only where necessary to achieve those purposes for the benefit of natural persons and society as a whole in particular in the context of the management of health or social care services and systems including processing by the management and central national health authorities of such data for the purpose of quality control management information and the general national and local supervision of the health or social care system and ensuring continuity of health or social care and cross-border healthcare or health security monitoring and alert purposes or for archiving purposes in the public interest scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes based on union or member state law which has to meet an objective of public interest as well as for studies conducted in the public interest in the area of public health therefore this regulation should provide for harmonised conditions for the processing of special categories of personal data concerning health in respect of specific needs in particular where the processing of such data is carried out for certain health-related purposes by persons subject to a legal obligation of professional secrecy union or member state law should provide for specific and suitable measures so as to protect the fundamental rights and the personal data of natural persons member states should be allowed to maintain or introduce further conditions including limitations with regard to the processing of genetic data biometric data or data concerning health however this should not hamper the free flow of personal data within the union when those conditions apply to cross-border processing of such data 54 the processing of special categories of personal data may be necessary for reasons of public interest in the areas of public health without consent of the data subject such processing should be subject to suitable and specific measures so as to protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons in that context ‘ public health ’ should be interpreted as defined in regulation ec no 1338/2008 of the european parliament and of the council 11 namely all elements related to health namely health status including morbidity and disability the determinants having an effect on that health status health care needs resources allocated to health care the provision of and universal access to health care as well as health care expenditure and financing and the causes of mortality such processing of data concerning health for reasons of public interest should not result in personal data being processed for other purposes by third parties such as employers or insurance and banking companies 55 moreover the processing of personal data by official authorities for the purpose of achieving the aims laid down by constitutional law or by international public law of officially recognised religious associations is carried out on grounds of public interest 56 where in the course of electoral activities the operation of the democratic system in a member state requires that political parties compile personal data on people 's political opinions the processing of such data may be permitted for reasons of public interest provided that appropriate safeguards are established 57 if the personal data processed by a controller do not permit the controller to identify a natural person the data controller should not be obliged to acquire additional information in order to identify the data subject for the sole purpose of complying with any provision of this regulation however the controller should not refuse to take additional information provided by the data subject in order to support the exercise of his or her rights identification should include the digital identification of a data subject for example through authentication mechanism such as the same credentials used by the data subject to log-in to the on-line service offered by the data controller 58 the principle of transparency requires that any information addressed to the public or to the data subject be concise easily accessible and easy to understand and that clear and plain language and additionally where appropriate visualisation be used such information could be provided in electronic form for example when addressed to the public through a website this is of particular relevance in situations where the proliferation of actors and the technological complexity of practice make it difficult for the data subject to know and understand whether by whom and for what purpose personal data relating to him or her are being collected such as in the case of online advertising given that children merit specific protection any information and communication where processing is addressed to a child should be in such a clear and plain language that the child can easily understand 59 modalities should be provided for facilitating the exercise of the data subject 's rights under this regulation including mechanisms to request and if applicable obtain free of charge in particular access to and rectification or erasure of personal data and the exercise of the right to object the controller should also provide means for requests to be made electronically especially where personal data are processed by electronic means the controller should be obliged to respond to requests from the data subject without undue delay and at the latest within one month and to give reasons where the controller does not intend to comply with any such requests 60 the principles of fair and transparent processing require that the data subject be informed of the existence of the processing operation and its purposes the controller should provide the data subject with any further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are processed furthermore the data subject should be informed of the existence of profiling and the consequences of such profiling where the personal data are collected from the data subject the data subject should also be informed whether he or she is obliged to provide the personal data and of the consequences where he or she does not provide such data that information may be provided in combination with standardised icons in order to give in an easily visible intelligible and clearly legible manner a meaningful overview of the intended processing where the icons are presented electronically they should be machine-readable 61 the information in relation to the processing of personal data relating to the data subject should be given to him or her at the time of collection from the data subject or where the personal data are obtained from another source within a reasonable period depending on the circumstances of the case where personal data can be legitimately disclosed to another recipient the data subject should be informed when the personal data are first disclosed to the recipient where the controller intends to process the personal data for a purpose other than that for which they were collected the controller should provide the data subject prior to that further processing with information on that other purpose and other necessary information where the origin of the personal data can not be provided to the data subject because various sources have been used general information should be provided 62 however it is not necessary to impose the obligation to provide information where the data subject already possesses the information where the recording or disclosure of the personal data is expressly laid down by law or where the provision of information to the data subject proves to be impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort the latter could in particular be the case where processing is carried out for archiving purposes in the public interest scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in that regard the number of data subjects the age of the data and any appropriate safeguards adopted should be taken into consideration 63 a data subject should have the right of access to personal data which have been collected concerning him or her and to exercise that right easily and at reasonable intervals in order to be aware of and verify the lawfulness of the processing this includes the right for data subjects to have access to data concerning their health for example the data in their medical records containing information such as diagnoses examination results assessments by treating physicians and any treatment or interventions provided every data subject should therefore have the right to know and obtain communication in particular with regard to the purposes for which the personal data are processed where possible the period for which the personal data are processed the recipients of the personal data the logic involved in any automatic personal data processing and at least when based on profiling the consequences of such processing where possible the controller should be able to provide remote access to a secure system which would provide the data subject with direct access to his or her personal data that right should not adversely affect the rights or freedoms of others including trade secrets or intellectual property and in particular the copyright protecting the software however the result of those considerations should not be a refusal to provide all information to the data subject where the controller processes a large quantity of information concerning the data subject the controller should be able to request that before the information is delivered the data subject specify the information or processing activities to which the request relates 64 the controller should use all reasonable measures to verify the identity of a data subject who requests access in particular in the context of online services and online identifiers a controller should not retain personal data for the sole purpose of being able to react to potential requests 65 a data subject should have the right to have personal data concerning him or her rectified and a ‘ right to be forgotten ’ where the retention of such data infringes this regulation or union or member state law to which the controller is subject in particular a data subject should have the right to have his or her personal data erased and no longer processed where the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are collected or otherwise processed where a data subject has withdrawn his or her consent or objects to the processing of personal data concerning him or her or where the processing of his or her personal data does not otherwise comply with this regulation that right is relevant in particular where the data subject has given his or her consent as a child and is not fully aware of the risks involved by the processing and later wants to remove such personal data especially on the internet the data subject should be able to exercise that right notwithstanding the fact that he or she is no longer a child however the further retention of the personal data should be lawful where it is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information for compliance with a legal obligation for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller on the grounds of public interest in the area of public health for archiving purposes in the public interest scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes or for the establishment exercise or defence of legal claims 66 to strengthen the right to be forgotten in the online environment the right to erasure should also be extended in such a way that a controller who has made the personal data public should be obliged to inform the controllers which are processing such personal data to erase any links to or copies or replications of those personal data in doing so that controller should take reasonable steps taking into account available technology and the means available to the controller including technical measures to inform the controllers which are processing the personal data of the data subject 's request 67 methods by which to restrict the processing of personal data could include inter alia temporarily moving the selected data to another processing system making the selected personal data unavailable to users or temporarily removing published data from a website in automated filing systems the restriction of processing should in principle be ensured by technical means in such a manner that the personal data are not subject to further processing operations and can not be changed the fact that the processing of personal data is restricted should be clearly indicated in the system 68 to further strengthen the control over his or her own data where the processing of personal data is carried out by automated means the data subject should also be allowed to receive personal data concerning him or her which he or she has provided to a controller in a structured commonly used machine-readable and interoperable format and to transmit it to another controller data controllers should be encouraged to develop interoperable formats that enable data portability that right should apply where the data subject provided the personal data on the basis of his or her consent or the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract it should not apply where processing is based on a legal ground other than consent or contract by its very nature that right should not be exercised against controllers processing personal data in the exercise of their public duties it should therefore not apply where the processing of the personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of an official authority vested in the controller the data subject 's right to transmit or receive personal data concerning him or her should not create an obligation for the controllers to adopt or maintain processing systems which are technically compatible where in a certain set of personal data more than one data subject is concerned the right to receive the personal data should be without prejudice to the rights and freedoms of other data subjects in accordance with this regulation furthermore that right should not prejudice the right of the data subject to obtain the erasure of personal data and the limitations of that right as set out in this regulation and should in particular not imply the erasure of personal data concerning the data subject which have been provided by him or her for the performance of a contract to the extent that and for as long as the personal data are necessary for the performance of that contract where technically feasible the data subject should have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another 69 where personal data might lawfully be processed because processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller or on grounds of the legitimate interests of a controller or a third party a data subject should nevertheless be entitled to object to the processing of any personal data relating to his or her particular situation it should be for the controller to demonstrate that its compelling legitimate interest overrides the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject 70 where personal data are processed for the purposes of direct marketing the data subject should have the right to object to such processing including profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing whether with regard to initial or further processing at any time and free of charge that right should be explicitly brought to the attention of the data subject and presented clearly and separately from any other information 71 the data subject should have the right not to be subject to a decision which may include a measure evaluating personal aspects relating to him or her which is based solely on automated processing and which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her such as automatic refusal of an online credit application or e-recruiting practices without any human intervention such processing includes ‘ profiling ’ that consists of any form of automated processing of personal data evaluating the personal aspects relating to a natural person in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning the data subject 's performance at work economic situation health personal preferences or interests reliability or behaviour location or movements where it produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her however decision-making based on such processing including profiling should be allowed where expressly authorised by union or member state law to which the controller is subject including for fraud and tax-evasion monitoring and prevention purposes conducted in accordance with the regulations standards and recommendations of union institutions or national oversight bodies and to ensure the security and reliability of a service provided by the controller or necessary for the entering or performance of a contract between the data subject and a controller or when the data subject has given his or her explicit consent in any case such processing should be subject to suitable safeguards which should include specific information to the data subject and the right to obtain human intervention to express his or her point of view to obtain an explanation of the decision reached after such assessment and to challenge the decision such measure should not concern a child in order to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the data subject taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are processed the controller should use appropriate mathematical or statistical procedures for the profiling implement technical and organisational measures appropriate to ensure in particular that factors which result in inaccuracies in personal data are corrected and the risk of errors is minimised secure personal data in a manner that takes account of the potential risks involved for the interests and rights of the data subject and that prevents inter alia discriminatory effects on natural persons on the basis of racial or ethnic origin political opinion religion or beliefs trade union membership genetic or health status or sexual orientation or that result in measures having such an effect automated decision-making and profiling based on special categories of personal data should be allowed only under specific conditions 72 profiling is subject to the rules of this regulation governing the processing of personal data such as the legal grounds for processing or data protection principles the european data protection board established by this regulation the ‘ board ’ should be able to issue guidance in that context 73 restrictions concerning specific principles and the rights of information access to and rectification or erasure of personal data the right to data portability the right to object decisions based on profiling as well as the communication of a personal data breach to a data subject and certain related obligations of the controllers may be imposed by union or member state law as far as necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard public security including the protection of human life especially in response to natural or manmade disasters the prevention investigation and prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security or of breaches of ethics for regulated professions other important objectives of general public interest of the union or of a member state in particular an important economic or financial interest of the union or of a member state the keeping of public registers kept for reasons of general public interest further processing of archived personal data to provide specific information related to the political behaviour under former totalitarian state regimes or the protection of the data subject or the rights and freedoms of others including social protection public health and humanitarian purposes those restrictions should be in accordance with the requirements set out in the charter and in the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 74 the responsibility and liability of the controller for any processing of personal data carried out by the controller or on the controller 's behalf should be established in particular the controller should be obliged to implement appropriate and effective measures and be able to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities with this regulation including the effectiveness of the measures those measures should take into account the nature scope context and purposes of the processing and the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons 75 the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons of varying likelihood and severity may result from personal data processing which could lead to physical material or non-material damage in particular where the processing may give rise to discrimination identity theft or fraud financial loss damage to the reputation loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional secrecy unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation or any other significant economic or social disadvantage where data subjects might be deprived of their rights and freedoms or prevented from exercising control over their personal data where personal data are processed which reveal racial or ethnic origin political opinions religion or philosophical beliefs trade union membership and the processing of genetic data data concerning health or data concerning sex life or criminal convictions and offences or related security measures where personal aspects are evaluated in particular analysing or predicting aspects concerning performance at work economic situation health personal preferences or interests reliability or behaviour location or movements in order to create or use personal profiles where personal data of vulnerable natural persons in particular of children are processed or where processing involves a large amount of personal data and affects a large number of data subjects 76 the likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject should be determined by reference to the nature scope context and purposes of the processing risk should be evaluated on the basis of an objective assessment by which it is established whether data processing operations involve a risk or a high risk 77 guidance on the implementation of appropriate measures and on the demonstration of compliance by the controller or the processor especially as regards the identification of the risk related to the processing their assessment in terms of origin nature likelihood and severity and the identification of best practices to mitigate the risk could be provided in particular by means of approved codes of conduct approved certifications guidelines provided by the board or indications provided by a data protection officer the board may also issue guidelines on processing operations that are considered to be unlikely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons and indicate what measures may be sufficient in such cases to address such risk 78 the protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data require that appropriate technical and organisational measures be taken to ensure that the requirements of this regulation are met in order to be able to demonstrate compliance with this regulation the controller should adopt internal policies and implement measures which meet in particular the principles of data protection by design and data protection by default such measures could consist inter alia of minimising the processing of personal data pseudonymising personal data as soon as possible transparency with regard to the functions and processing of personal data enabling the data subject to monitor the data processing enabling the controller to create and improve security features when developing designing selecting and using applications services and products that are based on the processing of personal data or process personal data to fulfil their task producers of the products services and applications should be encouraged to take into account the right to data protection when developing and designing such products services and applications and with due regard to the state of the art to make sure that controllers and processors are able to fulfil their data protection obligations the principles of data protection by design and by default should also be taken into consideration in the context of public tenders 79 the protection of the rights and freedoms of data subjects as well as the responsibility and liability of controllers and processors also in relation to the monitoring by and measures of supervisory authorities requires a clear allocation of the responsibilities under this regulation including where a controller determines the purposes and means of the processing jointly with other controllers or where a processing operation is carried out on behalf of a controller 80 where a controller or a processor not established in the union is processing personal data of data subjects who are in the union whose processing activities are related to the offering of goods or services irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required to such data subjects in the union or to the monitoring of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the union the controller or the processor should designate a representative unless the processing is occasional does not include processing on a large scale of special categories of personal data or the processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences and is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons taking into account the nature context scope and purposes of the processing or if the controller is a public authority or body the representative should act on behalf of the controller or the processor and may be addressed by any supervisory authority the representative should be explicitly designated by a written mandate of the controller or of the processor to act on its behalf with regard to its obligations under this regulation the designation of such a representative does not affect the responsibility or liability of the controller or of the processor under this regulation such a representative should perform its tasks according to the mandate received from the controller or processor including cooperating with the competent supervisory authorities with regard to any action taken to ensure compliance with this regulation the designated representative should be subject to enforcement proceedings in the event of non-compliance by the controller or processor 81 to ensure compliance with the requirements of this regulation in respect of the processing to be carried out by the processor on behalf of the controller when entrusting a processor with processing activities the controller should use only processors providing sufficient guarantees in particular in terms of expert knowledge reliability and resources to implement technical and organisational measures which will meet the requirements of this regulation including for the security of processing the adherence of the processor to an approved code of conduct or an approved certification mechanism may be used as an element to demonstrate compliance with the obligations of the controller the carrying-out of processing by a processor should be governed by a contract or other legal act under union or member state law binding the processor to the controller setting out the subject-matter and duration of the processing the nature and purposes of the processing the type of personal data and categories of data subjects taking into account the specific tasks and responsibilities of the processor in the context of the processing to be carried out and the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject the controller and processor may choose to use an individual contract or standard contractual clauses which are adopted either directly by the commission or by a supervisory authority in accordance with the consistency mechanism and then adopted by the commission after the completion of the processing on behalf of the controller the processor should at the choice of the controller return or delete the personal data unless there is a requirement to store the personal data under union or member state law to which the processor is subject 82 in order to demonstrate compliance with this regulation the controller or processor should maintain records of processing activities under its responsibility each controller and processor should be obliged to cooperate with the supervisory authority and make those records on request available to it so that it might serve for monitoring those processing operations 83 in order to maintain security and to prevent processing in infringement of this regulation the controller or processor should evaluate the risks inherent in the processing and implement measures to mitigate those risks such as encryption those measures should ensure an appropriate level of security including confidentiality taking into account the state of the art and the costs of implementation in relation to the risks and the nature of the personal data to be protected in assessing data security risk consideration should be given to the risks that are presented by personal data processing such as accidental or unlawful destruction loss alteration unauthorised disclosure of or access to personal data transmitted stored or otherwise processed which may in particular lead to physical material or non-material damage 84 in order to enhance compliance with this regulation where processing operations are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons the controller should be responsible for the carrying-out of a data protection impact assessment to evaluate in particular the origin nature particularity and severity of that risk the outcome of the assessment should be taken into account when determining the appropriate measures to be taken in order to demonstrate that the processing of personal data complies with this regulation where a data-protection impact assessment indicates that processing operations involve a high risk which the controller can not mitigate by appropriate measures in terms of available technology and costs of implementation a consultation of the supervisory authority should take place prior to the processing 85 a personal data breach may if not addressed in an appropriate and timely manner result in physical material or non-material damage to natural persons such as loss of control over their personal data or limitation of their rights discrimination identity theft or fraud financial loss unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation damage to reputation loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional secrecy or any other significant economic or social disadvantage to the natural person concerned therefore as soon as the controller becomes aware that a personal data breach has occurred the controller should notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay and where feasible not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it unless the controller is able to demonstrate in accordance with the accountability principle that the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons where such notification can not be achieved within 72 hours the reasons for the delay should accompany the notification and information may be provided in phases without undue further delay 86 the controller should communicate to the data subject a personal data breach without undue delay where that personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the natural person in order to allow him or her to take the necessary precautions the communication should describe the nature of the personal data breach as well as recommendations for the natural person concerned to mitigate potential adverse effects such communications to data subjects should be made as soon as reasonably feasible and in close cooperation with the supervisory authority respecting guidance provided by it or by other relevant authorities such as law-enforcement authorities for example the need to mitigate an immediate risk of damage would call for prompt communication with data subjects whereas the need to implement appropriate measures against continuing or similar personal data breaches may justify more time for communication 87 it should be ascertained whether all appropriate technological protection and organisational measures have been implemented to establish immediately whether a personal data breach has taken place and to inform promptly the supervisory authority and the data subject the fact that the notification was made without undue delay should be established taking into account in particular the nature and gravity of the personal data breach and its consequences and adverse effects for the data subject such notification may result in an intervention of the supervisory authority in accordance with its tasks and powers laid down in this regulation 88 in setting detailed rules concerning the format and procedures applicable to the notification of personal data breaches due consideration should be given to the circumstances of that breach including whether or not personal data had been protected by appropriate technical protection measures effectively limiting the likelihood of identity fraud or other forms of misuse moreover such rules and procedures should take into account the legitimate interests of law-enforcement authorities where early disclosure could unnecessarily hamper the investigation of the circumstances of a personal data breach 89 directive 95/46/ec provided for a general obligation to notify the processing of personal data to the supervisory authorities while that obligation produces administrative and financial burdens it did not in all cases contribute to improving the protection of personal data such indiscriminate general notification obligations should therefore be abolished and replaced by effective procedures and mechanisms which focus instead on those types of processing operations which are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons by virtue of their nature scope context and purposes such types of processing operations may be those which in particular involve using new technologies or are of a new kind and where no data protection impact assessment has been carried out before by the controller or where they become necessary in the light of the time that has elapsed since the initial processing 90 in such cases a data protection impact assessment should be carried out by the controller prior to the processing in order to assess the particular likelihood and severity of the high risk taking into account the nature scope context and purposes of the processing and the sources of the risk that impact assessment should include in particular the measures safeguards and mechanisms envisaged for mitigating that risk ensuring the protection of personal data and demonstrating compliance with this regulation 91 this should in particular apply to large-scale processing operations which aim to process a considerable amount of personal data at regional national or supranational level and which could affect a large number of data subjects and which are likely to result in a high risk for example on account of their sensitivity where in accordance with the achieved state of technological knowledge a new technology is used on a large scale as well as to other processing operations which result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects in particular where those operations render it more difficult for data subjects to exercise their rights a data protection impact assessment should also be made where personal data are processed for taking decisions regarding specific natural persons following any systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons based on profiling those data or following the processing of special categories of personal data biometric data or data on criminal convictions and offences or related security measures a data protection impact assessment is equally required for monitoring publicly accessible areas on a large scale especially when using optic-electronic devices or for any other operations where the competent supervisory authority considers that the processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects in particular because they prevent data subjects from exercising a right or using a service or a contract or because they are carried out systematically on a large scale the processing of personal data should not be considered to be on a large scale if the processing concerns personal data from patients or clients by an individual physician other health care professional or lawyer in such cases a data protection impact assessment should not be mandatory 92 there are circumstances under which it may be reasonable and economical for the subject of a data protection impact assessment to be broader than a single project for example where public authorities or bodies intend to establish a common application or processing platform or where several controllers plan to introduce a common application or processing environment across an industry sector or segment or for a widely used horizontal activity 93 in the context of the adoption of the member state law on which the performance of the tasks of the public authority or public body is based and which regulates the specific processing operation or set of operations in question member states may deem it necessary to carry out such assessment prior to the processing activities 94 where a data protection impact assessment indicates that the processing would in the absence of safeguards security measures and mechanisms to mitigate the risk result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons and the controller is of the opinion that the risk can not be mitigated by reasonable means in terms of available technologies and costs of implementation the supervisory authority should be consulted prior to the start of processing activities such high risk is likely to result from certain types of processing and the extent and frequency of processing which may result also in a realisation of damage or interference with the rights and freedoms of the natural person the supervisory authority should respond to the request for consultation within a specified period however the absence of a reaction of the supervisory authority within that period should be without prejudice to any intervention of the supervisory authority in accordance with its tasks and powers laid down in this regulation including the power to prohibit processing operations as part of that consultation process the outcome of a data protection impact assessment carried out with regard to the processing at issue may be submitted to the supervisory authority in particular the measures envisaged to mitigate the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons 95 the processor should assist the controller where necessary and upon request in ensuring compliance with the obligations deriving from the carrying out of data protection impact assessments and from prior consultation of the supervisory authority 96 a consultation of the supervisory authority should also take place in the course of the preparation of a legislative or regulatory measure which provides for the processing of personal data in order to ensure compliance of the intended processing with this regulation and in particular to mitigate the risk involved for the data subject 97 where the processing is carried out by a public authority except for courts or independent judicial authorities when acting in their judicial capacity where in the private sector processing is carried out by a controller whose core activities consist of processing operations that require regular and systematic monitoring of the data subjects on a large scale or where the core activities of the controller or the processor consist of processing on a large scale of special categories of personal data and data relating to criminal convictions and offences a person with expert knowledge of data protection law and practices should assist the controller or processor to monitor internal compliance with this regulation in the private sector the core activities of a controller relate to its primary activities and do not relate to the processing of personal data as ancillary activities the necessary level of expert knowledge should be determined in particular according to the data processing operations carried out and the protection required for the personal data processed by the controller or the processor such data protection officers whether or not they are an employee of the controller should be in a position to perform their duties and tasks in an independent manner 98 associations or other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors should be encouraged to draw up codes of conduct within the limits of this regulation so as to facilitate the effective application of this regulation taking account of the specific characteristics of the processing carried out in certain sectors and the specific needs of micro small and medium enterprises in particular such codes of conduct could calibrate the obligations of controllers and processors taking into account the risk likely to result from the processing for the rights and freedoms of natural persons 99 when drawing up a code of conduct or when amending or extending such a code associations and other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors should consult relevant stakeholders including data subjects where feasible and have regard to submissions received and views expressed in response to such consultations 100 in order to enhance transparency and compliance with this regulation the establishment of certification mechanisms and data protection seals and marks should be encouraged allowing data subjects to quickly assess the level of data protection of relevant products and services 101 flows of personal data to and from countries outside the union and international organisations are necessary for the expansion of international trade and international cooperation the increase in such flows has raised new challenges and concerns with regard to the protection of personal data however when personal data are transferred from the union to controllers processors or other recipients in third countries or to international organisations the level of protection of natural persons ensured in the union by this regulation should not be undermined including in cases of onward transfers of personal data from the third country or international organisation to controllers processors in the same or another third country or international organisation in any event transfers to third countries and international organisations may only be carried out in full compliance with this regulation a transfer could take place only if subject to the other provisions of this regulation the conditions laid down in the provisions of this regulation relating to the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations are complied with by the controller or processor 102 this regulation is without prejudice to international agreements concluded between the union and third countries regulating the transfer of personal data including appropriate safeguards for the data subjects member states may conclude international agreements which involve the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations as far as such agreements do not affect this regulation or any other provisions of union law and include an appropriate level of protection for the fundamental rights of the data subjects 103 the commission may decide with effect for the entire union that a third country a territory or specified sector within a third country or an international organisation offers an adequate level of data protection thus providing legal certainty and uniformity throughout the union as regards the third country or international organisation which is considered to provide such level of protection in such cases transfers of personal data to that third country or international organisation may take place without the need to obtain any further authorisation the commission may also decide having given notice and a full statement setting out the reasons to the third country or international organisation to revoke such a decision 104 in line with the fundamental values on which the union is founded in particular the protection of human rights the commission should in its assessment of the third country or of a territory or specified sector within a third country take into account how a particular third country respects the rule of law access to justice as well as international human rights norms and standards and its general and sectoral law including legislation concerning public security defence and national security as well as public order and criminal law the adoption of an adequacy decision with regard to a territory or a specified sector in a third country should take into account clear and objective criteria such as specific processing activities and the scope of applicable legal standards and legislation in force in the third country the third country should offer guarantees ensuring an adequate level of protection essentially equivalent to that ensured within the union in particular where personal data are processed in one or several specific sectors in particular the third country should ensure effective independent data protection supervision and should provide for cooperation mechanisms with the member states data protection authorities and the data subjects should be provided with effective and enforceable rights and effective administrative and judicial redress 105 apart from the international commitments the third country or international organisation has entered into the commission should take account of obligations arising from the third country 's or international organisation 's participation in multilateral or regional systems in particular in relation to the protection of personal data as well as the implementation of such obligations in particular the third country 's accession to the council of europe convention of 28 january 1981 for the protection of individuals with regard to the automatic processing of personal data and its additional protocol should be taken into account the commission should consult the board when assessing the level of protection in third countries or international organisations 106 the commission should monitor the functioning of decisions on the level of protection in a third country a territory or specified sector within a third country or an international organisation and monitor the functioning of decisions adopted on the basis of article 25 6 or article 26 4 of directive 95/46/ec in its adequacy decisions the commission should provide for a periodic review mechanism of their functioning that periodic review should be conducted in consultation with the third country or international organisation in question and take into account all relevant developments in the third country or international organisation for the purposes of monitoring and of carrying out the periodic reviews the commission should take into consideration the views and findings of the european parliament and of the council as well as of other relevant bodies and sources the commission should evaluate within a reasonable time the functioning of the latter decisions and report any relevant findings to the committee within the meaning of regulation eu no 182/2011 of the european parliament and of the council 12 as established under this regulation to the european parliament and to the council 107 the commission may recognise that a third country a territory or a specified sector within a third country or an international organisation no longer ensures an adequate level of data protection consequently the transfer of personal data to that third country or international organisation should be prohibited unless the requirements in this regulation relating to transfers subject to appropriate safeguards including binding corporate rules and derogations for specific situations are fulfilled in that case provision should be made for consultations between the commission and such third countries or international organisations the commission should in a timely manner inform the third country or international organisation of the reasons and enter into consultations with it in order to remedy the situation 108 in the absence of an adequacy decision the controller or processor should take measures to compensate for the lack of data protection in a third country by way of appropriate safeguards for the data subject such appropriate safeguards may consist of making use of binding corporate rules standard data protection clauses adopted by the commission standard data protection clauses adopted by a supervisory authority or contractual clauses authorised by a supervisory authority those safeguards should ensure compliance with data protection requirements and the rights of the data subjects appropriate to processing within the union including the availability of enforceable data subject rights and of effective legal remedies including to obtain effective administrative or judicial redress and to claim compensation in the union or in a third country they should relate in particular to compliance with the general principles relating to personal data processing the principles of data protection by design and by default transfers may also be carried out by public authorities or bodies with public authorities or bodies in third countries or with international organisations with corresponding duties or functions including on the basis of provisions to be inserted into administrative arrangements such as a memorandum of understanding providing for enforceable and effective rights for data subjects authorisation by the competent supervisory authority should be obtained when the safeguards are provided for in administrative arrangements that are not legally binding 109 the possibility for the controller or processor to use standard data-protection clauses adopted by the commission or by a supervisory authority should prevent controllers or processors neither from including the standard data-protection clauses in a wider contract such as a contract between the processor and another processor nor from adding other clauses or additional safeguards provided that they do not contradict directly or indirectly the standard contractual clauses adopted by the commission or by a supervisory authority or prejudice the fundamental rights or freedoms of the data subjects controllers and processors should be encouraged to provide additional safeguards via contractual commitments that supplement standard protection clauses 110 a group of undertakings or a group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity should be able to make use of approved binding corporate rules for its international transfers from the union to organisations within the same group of undertakings or group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity provided that such corporate rules include all essential principles and enforceable rights to ensure appropriate safeguards for transfers or categories of transfers of personal data 111 provisions should be made for the possibility for transfers in certain circumstances where the data subject has given his or her explicit consent where the transfer is occasional and necessary in relation to a contract or a legal claim regardless of whether in a judicial procedure or whether in an administrative or any out-of-court procedure including procedures before regulatory bodies provision should also be made for the possibility for transfers where important grounds of public interest laid down by union or member state law so require or where the transfer is made from a register established by law and intended for consultation by the public or persons having a legitimate interest in the latter case such a transfer should not involve the entirety of the personal data or entire categories of the data contained in the register and when the register is intended for consultation by persons having a legitimate interest the transfer should be made only at the request of those persons or if they are to be the recipients taking into full account the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject 112 those derogations should in particular apply to data transfers required and necessary for important reasons of public interest for example in cases of international data exchange between competition authorities tax or customs administrations between financial supervisory authorities between services competent for social security matters or for public health for example in the case of contact tracing for contagious diseases or in order to reduce and/or eliminate doping in sport a transfer of personal data should also be regarded as lawful where it is necessary to protect an interest which is essential for the data subject 's or another person 's vital interests including physical integrity or life if the data subject is incapable of giving consent in the absence of an adequacy decision union or member state law may for important reasons of public interest expressly set limits to the transfer of specific categories of data to a third country or an international organisation member states should notify such provisions to the commission any transfer to an international humanitarian organisation of personal data of a data subject who is physically or legally incapable of giving consent with a view to accomplishing a task incumbent under the geneva conventions or to complying with international humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts could be considered to be necessary for an important reason of public interest or because it is in the vital interest of the data subject 113 transfers which can be qualified as not repetitive and that only concern a limited number of data subjects could also be possible for the purposes of the compelling legitimate interests pursued by the controller when those interests are not overridden by the interests or rights and freedoms of the data subject and when the controller has assessed all the circumstances surrounding the data transfer the controller should give particular consideration to the nature of the personal data the purpose and duration of the proposed processing operation or operations as well as the situation in the country of origin the third country and the country of final destination and should provide suitable safeguards to protect fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data such transfers should be possible only in residual cases where none of the other grounds for transfer are applicable for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes the legitimate expectations of society for an increase of knowledge should be taken into consideration the controller should inform the supervisory authority and the data subject about the transfer 114 in any case where the commission has taken no decision on the adequate level of data protection in a third country the controller or processor should make use of solutions that provide data subjects with enforceable and effective rights as regards the processing of their data in the union once those data have been transferred so that that they will continue to benefit from fundamental rights and safeguards 115 some third countries adopt laws regulations and other legal acts which purport to directly regulate the processing activities of natural and legal persons under the jurisdiction of the member states this may include judgments of courts or tribunals or decisions of administrative authorities in third countries requiring a controller or processor to transfer or disclose personal data and which are not based on an international agreement such as a mutual legal assistance treaty in force between the requesting third country and the union or a member state the extraterritorial application of those laws regulations and other legal acts may be in breach of international law and may impede the attainment of the protection of natural persons ensured in the union by this regulation transfers should only be allowed where the conditions of this regulation for a transfer to third countries are met this may be the case inter alia where disclosure is necessary for an important ground of public interest recognised in union or member state law to which the controller is subject 116 when personal data moves across borders outside the union it may put at increased risk the ability of natural persons to exercise data protection rights in particular to protect themselves from the unlawful use or disclosure of that information at the same time supervisory authorities may find that they are unable to pursue complaints or conduct investigations relating to the activities outside their borders their efforts to work together in the cross-border context may also be hampered by insufficient preventative or remedial powers inconsistent legal regimes and practical obstacles like resource constraints therefore there is a need to promote closer cooperation among data protection supervisory authorities to help them exchange information and carry out investigations with their international counterparts for the purposes of developing international cooperation mechanisms to facilitate and provide international mutual assistance for the enforcement of legislation for the protection of personal data the commission and the supervisory authorities should exchange information and cooperate in activities related to the exercise of their powers with competent authorities in third countries based on reciprocity and in accordance with this regulation 117 the establishment of supervisory authorities in member states empowered to perform their tasks and exercise their powers with complete independence is an essential component of the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data member states should be able to establish more than one supervisory authority to reflect their constitutional organisational and administrative structure 118 the independence of supervisory authorities should not mean that the supervisory authorities can not be subject to control or monitoring mechanisms regarding their financial expenditure or to judicial review 119 where a member state establishes several supervisory authorities it should establish by law mechanisms for ensuring the effective participation of those supervisory authorities in the consistency mechanism that member state should in particular designate the supervisory authority which functions as a single contact point for the effective participation of those authorities in the mechanism to ensure swift and smooth cooperation with other supervisory authorities the board and the commission 120 each supervisory authority should be provided with the financial and human resources premises and infrastructure necessary for the effective performance of their tasks including those related to mutual assistance and cooperation with other supervisory authorities throughout the union each supervisory authority should have a separate public annual budget which may be part of the overall state or national budget 121 the general conditions for the member or members of the supervisory authority should be laid down by law in each member state and should in particular provide that those members are to be appointed by means of a transparent procedure either by the parliament government or the head of state of the member state on the basis of a proposal from the government a member of the government the parliament or a chamber of the parliament or by an independent body entrusted under member state law in order to ensure the independence of the supervisory authority the member or members should act with integrity refrain from any action that is incompatible with their duties and should not during their term of office engage in any incompatible occupation whether gainful or not the supervisory authority should have its own staff chosen by the supervisory authority or an independent body established by member state law which should be subject to the exclusive direction of the member or members of the supervisory authority 122 each supervisory authority should be competent on the territory of its own member state to exercise the powers and to perform the tasks conferred on it in accordance with this regulation this should cover in particular the processing in the context of the activities of an establishment of the controller or processor on the territory of its own member state the processing of personal data carried out by public authorities or private bodies acting in the public interest processing affecting data subjects on its territory or processing carried out by a controller or processor not established in the union when targeting data subjects residing on its territory this should include handling complaints lodged by a data subject conducting investigations on the application of this regulation and promoting public awareness of the risks rules safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data 123 the supervisory authorities should monitor the application of the provisions pursuant to this regulation and contribute to its consistent application throughout the union in order to protect natural persons in relation to the processing of their personal data and to facilitate the free flow of personal data within the internal market for that purpose the supervisory authorities should cooperate with each other and with the commission without the need for any agreement between member states on the provision of mutual assistance or on such cooperation 124 where the processing of personal data takes place in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the union and the controller or processor is established in more than one member state or where processing taking place in the context of the activities of a single establishment of a controller or processor in the union substantially affects or is likely to substantially affect data subjects in more than one member state the supervisory authority for the main establishment of the controller or processor or for the single establishment of the controller or processor should act as lead authority it should cooperate with the other authorities concerned because the controller or processor has an establishment on the territory of their member state because data subjects residing on their territory are substantially affected or because a complaint has been lodged with them also where a data subject not residing in that member state has lodged a complaint the supervisory authority with which such complaint has been lodged should also be a supervisory authority concerned within its tasks to issue guidelines on any question covering the application of this regulation the board should be able to issue guidelines in particular on the criteria to be taken into account in order to ascertain whether the processing in question substantially affects data subjects in more than one member state and on what constitutes a relevant and reasoned objection 125 the lead authority should be competent to adopt binding decisions regarding measures applying the powers conferred on it in accordance with this regulation in its capacity as lead authority the supervisory authority should closely involve and coordinate the supervisory authorities concerned in the decision-making process where the decision is to reject the complaint by the data subject in whole or in part that decision should be adopted by the supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged 126 the decision should be agreed jointly by the lead supervisory authority and the supervisory authorities concerned and should be directed towards the main or single establishment of the controller or processor and be binding on the controller and processor the controller or processor should take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with this regulation and the implementation of the decision notified by the lead supervisory authority to the main establishment of the controller or processor as regards the processing activities in the union 127 each supervisory authority not acting as the lead supervisory authority should be competent to handle local cases where the controller or processor is established in more than one member state but the subject matter of the specific processing concerns only processing carried out in a single member state and involves only data subjects in that single member state for example where the subject matter concerns the processing of employees personal data in the specific employment context of a member state in such cases the supervisory authority should inform the lead supervisory authority without delay about the matter after being informed the lead supervisory authority should decide whether it will handle the case pursuant to the provision on cooperation between the lead supervisory authority and other supervisory authorities concerned ‘ one-stop-shop mechanism ’ or whether the supervisory authority which informed it should handle the case at local level when deciding whether it will handle the case the lead supervisory authority should take into account whether there is an establishment of the controller or processor in the member state of the supervisory authority which informed it in order to ensure effective enforcement of a decision vis-à-vis the controller or processor where the lead supervisory authority decides to handle the case the supervisory authority which informed it should have the possibility to submit a draft for a decision of which the lead supervisory authority should take utmost account when preparing its draft decision in that one-stop-shop mechanism 128 the rules on the lead supervisory authority and the one-stop-shop mechanism should not apply where the processing is carried out by public authorities or private bodies in the public interest in such cases the only supervisory authority competent to exercise the powers conferred to it in accordance with this regulation should be the supervisory authority of the member state where the public authority or private body is established 129 in order to ensure consistent monitoring and enforcement of this regulation throughout the union the supervisory authorities should have in each member state the same tasks and effective powers including powers of investigation corrective powers and sanctions and authorisation and advisory powers in particular in cases of complaints from natural persons and without prejudice to the powers of prosecutorial authorities under member state law to bring infringements of this regulation to the attention of the judicial authorities and engage in legal proceedings such powers should also include the power to impose a temporary or definitive limitation including a ban on processing member states may specify other tasks related to the protection of personal data under this regulation the powers of supervisory authorities should be exercised in accordance with appropriate procedural safeguards set out in union and member state law impartially fairly and within a reasonable time in particular each measure should be appropriate necessary and proportionate in view of ensuring compliance with this regulation taking into account the circumstances of each individual case respect the right of every person to be heard before any individual measure which would affect him or her adversely is taken and avoid superfluous costs and excessive inconveniences for the persons concerned investigatory powers as regards access to premises should be exercised in accordance with specific requirements in member state procedural law such as the requirement to obtain a prior judicial authorisation each legally binding measure of the supervisory authority should be in writing be clear and unambiguous indicate the supervisory authority which has issued the measure the date of issue of the measure bear the signature of the head or a member of the supervisory authority authorised by him or her give the reasons for the measure and refer to the right of an effective remedy this should not preclude additional requirements pursuant to member state procedural law the adoption of a legally binding decision implies that it may give rise to judicial review in the member state of the supervisory authority that adopted the decision 130 where the supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged is not the lead supervisory authority the lead supervisory authority should closely cooperate with the supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged in accordance with the provisions on cooperation and consistency laid down in this regulation in such cases the lead supervisory authority should when taking measures intended to produce legal effects including the imposition of administrative fines take utmost account of the view of the supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged and which should remain competent to carry out any investigation on the territory of its own member state in liaison with the competent supervisory authority 131 where another supervisory authority should act as a lead supervisory authority for the processing activities of the controller or processor but the concrete subject matter of a complaint or the possible infringement concerns only processing activities of the controller or processor in the member state where the complaint has been lodged or the possible infringement detected and the matter does not substantially affect or is not likely to substantially affect data subjects in other member states the supervisory authority receiving a complaint or detecting or being informed otherwise of situations that entail possible infringements of this regulation should seek an amicable settlement with the controller and if this proves unsuccessful exercise its full range of powers this should include specific processing carried out in the territory of the member state of the supervisory authority or with regard to data subjects on the territory of that member state processing that is carried out in the context of an offer of goods or services specifically aimed at data subjects in the territory of the member state of the supervisory authority or processing that has to be assessed taking into account relevant legal obligations under member state law 132 awareness-raising activities by supervisory authorities addressed to the public should include specific measures directed at controllers and processors including micro small and medium-sized enterprises as well as natural persons in particular in the educational context 133 the supervisory authorities should assist each other in performing their tasks and provide mutual assistance so as to ensure the consistent application and enforcement of this regulation in the internal market a supervisory authority requesting mutual assistance may adopt a provisional measure if it receives no response to a request for mutual assistance within one month of the receipt of that request by the other supervisory authority 134 each supervisory authority should where appropriate participate in joint operations with other supervisory authorities the requested supervisory authority should be obliged to respond to the request within a specified time period 135 in order to ensure the consistent application of this regulation throughout the union a consistency mechanism for cooperation between the supervisory authorities should be established that mechanism should in particular apply where a supervisory authority intends to adopt a measure intended to produce legal effects as regards processing operations which substantially affect a significant number of data subjects in several member states it should also apply where any supervisory authority concerned or the commission requests that such matter should be handled in the consistency mechanism that mechanism should be without prejudice to any measures that the commission may take in the exercise of its powers under the treaties 136 in applying the consistency mechanism the board should within a determined period of time issue an opinion if a majority of its members so decides or if so requested by any supervisory authority concerned or the commission the board should also be empowered to adopt legally binding decisions where there are disputes between supervisory authorities for that purpose it should issue in principle by a two-thirds majority of its members legally binding decisions in clearly specified cases where there are conflicting views among supervisory authorities in particular in the cooperation mechanism between the lead supervisory authority and supervisory authorities concerned on the merits of the case in particular whether there is an infringement of this regulation 137 there may be an urgent need to act in order to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects in particular when the danger exists that the enforcement of a right of a data subject could be considerably impeded a supervisory authority should therefore be able to adopt duly justified provisional measures on its territory with a specified period of validity which should not exceed three months 138 the application of such mechanism should be a condition for the lawfulness of a measure intended to produce legal effects by a supervisory authority in those cases where its application is mandatory in other cases of cross-border relevance the cooperation mechanism between the lead supervisory authority and supervisory authorities concerned should be applied and mutual assistance and joint operations might be carried out between the supervisory authorities concerned on a bilateral or multilateral basis without triggering the consistency mechanism 139 in order to promote the consistent application of this regulation the board should be set up as an independent body of the union to fulfil its objectives the board should have legal personality the board should be represented by its chair it should replace the working party on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data established by directive 95/46/ec it should consist of the head of a supervisory authority of each member state and the european data protection supervisor or their respective representatives the commission should participate in the board 's activities without voting rights and the european data protection supervisor should have specific voting rights the board should contribute to the consistent application of this regulation throughout the union including by advising the commission in particular on the level of protection in third countries or international organisations and promoting cooperation of the supervisory authorities throughout the union the board should act independently when performing its tasks 140 the board should be assisted by a secretariat provided by the european data protection supervisor the staff of the european data protection supervisor involved in carrying out the tasks conferred on the board by this regulation should perform its tasks exclusively under the instructions of and report to the chair of the board 141 every data subject should have the right to lodge a complaint with a single supervisory authority in particular in the member state of his or her habitual residence and the right to an effective judicial remedy in accordance with article 47 of the charter if the data subject considers that his or her rights under this regulation are infringed or where the supervisory authority does not act on a complaint partially or wholly rejects or dismisses a complaint or does not act where such action is necessary to protect the rights of the data subject the investigation following a complaint should be carried out subject to judicial review to the extent that is appropriate in the specific case the supervisory authority should inform the data subject of the progress and the outcome of the complaint within a reasonable period if the case requires further investigation or coordination with another supervisory authority intermediate information should be given to the data subject in order to facilitate the submission of complaints each supervisory authority should take measures such as providing a complaint submission form which can also be completed electronically without excluding other means of communication 142 where a data subject considers that his or her rights under this regulation are infringed he or she should have the right to mandate a not-for-profit body organisation or association which is constituted in accordance with the law of a member state has statutory objectives which are in the public interest and is active in the field of the protection of personal data to lodge a complaint on his or her behalf with a supervisory authority exercise the right to a judicial remedy on behalf of data subjects or if provided for in member state law exercise the right to receive compensation on behalf of data subjects a member state may provide for such a body organisation or association to have the right to lodge a complaint in that member state independently of a data subject 's mandate and the right to an effective judicial remedy where it has reasons to consider that the rights of a data subject have been infringed as a result of the processing of personal data which infringes this regulation that body organisation or association may not be allowed to claim compensation on a data subject 's behalf independently of the data subject 's mandate 143 any natural or legal person has the right to bring an action for annulment of decisions of the board before the court of justice under the conditions provided for in article 263 tfeu as addressees of such decisions the supervisory authorities concerned which wish to challenge them have to bring action within two months of being notified of them in accordance with article 263 tfeu where decisions of the board are of direct and individual concern to a controller processor or complainant the latter may bring an action for annulment against those decisions within two months of their publication on the website of the board in accordance with article 263 tfeu without prejudice to this right under article 263 tfeu each natural or legal person should have an effective judicial remedy before the competent national court against a decision of a supervisory authority which produces legal effects concerning that person such a decision concerns in particular the exercise of investigative corrective and authorisation powers by the supervisory authority or the dismissal or rejection of complaints however the right to an effective judicial remedy does not encompass measures taken by supervisory authorities which are not legally binding such as opinions issued by or advice provided by the supervisory authority proceedings against a supervisory authority should be brought before the courts of the member state where the supervisory authority is established and should be conducted in accordance with that member state 's procedural law those courts should exercise full jurisdiction which should include jurisdiction to examine all questions of fact and law relevant to the dispute before them where a complaint has been rejected or dismissed by a supervisory authority the complainant may bring proceedings before the courts in the same member state in the context of judicial remedies relating to the application of this regulation national courts which consider a decision on the question necessary to enable them to give judgment may or in the case provided for in article 267 tfeu must request the court of justice to give a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of union law including this regulation furthermore where a decision of a supervisory authority implementing a decision of the board is challenged before a national court and the validity of the decision of the board is at issue that national court does not have the power to declare the board 's decision invalid but must refer the question of validity to the court of justice in accordance with article 267 tfeu as interpreted by the court of justice where it considers the decision invalid however a national court may not refer a question on the validity of the decision of the board at the request of a natural or legal person which had the opportunity to bring an action for annulment of that decision in particular if it was directly and individually concerned by that decision but had not done so within the period laid down in article 263 tfeu 144 where a court seized of proceedings against a decision by a supervisory authority has reason to believe that proceedings concerning the same processing such as the same subject matter as regards processing by the same controller or processor or the same cause of action are brought before a competent court in another member state it should contact that court in order to confirm the existence of such related proceedings if related proceedings are pending before a court in another member state any court other than the court first seized may stay its proceedings or may on request of one of the parties decline jurisdiction in favour of the court first seized if that court has jurisdiction over the proceedings in question and its law permits the consolidation of such related proceedings proceedings are deemed to be related where they are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together in order to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings 145 for proceedings against a controller or processor the plaintiff should have the choice to bring the action before the courts of the member states where the controller or processor has an establishment or where the data subject resides unless the controller is a public authority of a member state acting in the exercise of its public powers 146 the controller or processor should compensate any damage which a person may suffer as a result of processing that infringes this regulation the controller or processor should be exempt from liability if it proves that it is not in any way responsible for the damage the concept of damage should be broadly interpreted in the light of the case-law of the court of justice in a manner which fully reflects the objectives of this regulation this is without prejudice to any claims for damage deriving from the violation of other rules in union or member state law processing that infringes this regulation also includes processing that infringes delegated and implementing acts adopted in accordance with this regulation and member state law specifying rules of this regulation data subjects should receive full and effective compensation for the damage they have suffered where controllers or processors are involved in the same processing each controller or processor should be held liable for the entire damage however where they are joined to the same judicial proceedings in accordance with member state law compensation may be apportioned according to the responsibility of each controller or processor for the damage caused by the processing provided that full and effective compensation of the data subject who suffered the damage is ensured any controller or processor which has paid full compensation may subsequently institute recourse proceedings against other controllers or processors involved in the same processing 147 where specific rules on jurisdiction are contained in this regulation in particular as regards proceedings seeking a judicial remedy including compensation against a controller or processor general jurisdiction rules such as those of regulation eu no 1215/2012 of the european parliament and of the council 13 should not prejudice the application of such specific rules 148 in order to strengthen the enforcement of the rules of this regulation penalties including administrative fines should be imposed for any infringement of this regulation in addition to or instead of appropriate measures imposed by the supervisory authority pursuant to this regulation in a case of a minor infringement or if the fine likely to be imposed would constitute a disproportionate burden to a natural person a reprimand may be issued instead of a fine due regard should however be given to the nature gravity and duration of the infringement the intentional character of the infringement actions taken to mitigate the damage suffered degree of responsibility or any relevant previous infringements the manner in which the infringement became known to the supervisory authority compliance with measures ordered against the controller or processor adherence to a code of conduct and any other aggravating or mitigating factor the imposition of penalties including administrative fines should be subject to appropriate procedural safeguards in accordance with the general principles of union law and the charter including effective judicial protection and due process 149 member states should be able to lay down the rules on criminal penalties for infringements of this regulation including for infringements of national rules adopted pursuant to and within the limits of this regulation those criminal penalties may also allow for the deprivation of the profits obtained through infringements of this regulation however the imposition of criminal penalties for infringements of such national rules and of administrative penalties should not lead to a breach of the principle of ne bis in idem as interpreted by the court of justice 150 in order to strengthen and harmonise administrative penalties for infringements of this regulation each supervisory authority should have the power to impose administrative fines this regulation should indicate infringements and the upper limit and criteria for setting the related administrative fines which should be determined by the competent supervisory authority in each individual case taking into account all relevant circumstances of the specific situation with due regard in particular to the nature gravity and duration of the infringement and of its consequences and the measures taken to ensure compliance with the obligations under this regulation and to prevent or mitigate the consequences of the infringement where administrative fines are imposed on an undertaking an undertaking should be understood to be an undertaking in accordance with articles 101 and 102 tfeu for those purposes where administrative fines are imposed on persons that are not an undertaking the supervisory authority should take account of the general level of income in the member state as well as the economic situation of the person in considering the appropriate amount of the fine the consistency mechanism may also be used to promote a consistent application of administrative fines it should be for the member states to determine whether and to which extent public authorities should be subject to administrative fines imposing an administrative fine or giving a warning does not affect the application of other powers of the supervisory authorities or of other penalties under this regulation 151 the legal systems of denmark and estonia do not allow for administrative fines as set out in this regulation the rules on administrative fines may be applied in such a manner that in denmark the fine is imposed by competent national courts as a criminal penalty and in estonia the fine is imposed by the supervisory authority in the framework of a misdemeanour procedure provided that such an application of the rules in those member states has an equivalent effect to administrative fines imposed by supervisory authorities therefore the competent national courts should take into account the recommendation by the supervisory authority initiating the fine in any event the fines imposed should be effective proportionate and dissuasive 152 where this regulation does not harmonise administrative penalties or where necessary in other cases for example in cases of serious infringements of this regulation member states should implement a system which provides for effective proportionate and dissuasive penalties the nature of such penalties criminal or administrative should be determined by member state law 153 member states law should reconcile the rules governing freedom of expression and information including journalistic academic artistic and or literary expression with the right to the protection of personal data pursuant to this regulation the processing of personal data solely for journalistic purposes or for the purposes of academic artistic or literary expression should be subject to derogations or exemptions from certain provisions of this regulation if necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the right to freedom of expression and information as enshrined in article 11 of the charter this should apply in particular to the processing of personal data in the audiovisual field and in news archives and press libraries therefore member states should adopt legislative measures which lay down the exemptions and derogations necessary for the purpose of balancing those fundamental rights member states should adopt such exemptions and derogations on general principles the rights of the data subject the controller and the processor the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations the independent supervisory authorities cooperation and consistency and specific data-processing situations where such exemptions or derogations differ from one member state to another the law of the member state to which the controller is subject should apply in order to take account of the importance of the right to freedom of expression in every democratic society it is necessary to interpret notions relating to that freedom such as journalism broadly 154 this regulation allows the principle of public access to official documents to be taken into account when applying this regulation public access to official documents may be considered to be in the public interest personal data in documents held by a public authority or a public body should be able to be publicly disclosed by that authority or body if the disclosure is provided for by union or member state law to which the public authority or public body is subject such laws should reconcile public access to official documents and the reuse of public sector information with the right to the protection of personal data and may therefore provide for the necessary reconciliation with the right to the protection of personal data pursuant to this regulation the reference to public authorities and bodies should in that context include all authorities or other bodies covered by member state law on public access to documents directive 2003/98/ec of the european parliament and of the council 14 leaves intact and in no way affects the level of protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data under the provisions of union and member state law and in particular does not alter the obligations and rights set out in this regulation in particular that directive should not apply to documents to which access is excluded or restricted by virtue of the access regimes on the grounds of protection of personal data and parts of documents accessible by virtue of those regimes which contain personal data the re-use of which has been provided for by law as being incompatible with the law concerning the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data 155 member state law or collective agreements including ‘ works agreements ’ may provide for specific rules on the processing of employees personal data in the employment context in particular for the conditions under which personal data in the employment context may be processed on the basis of the consent of the employee the purposes of the recruitment the performance of the contract of employment including discharge of obligations laid down by law or by collective agreements management planning and organisation of work equality and diversity in the workplace health and safety at work and for the purposes of the exercise and enjoyment on an individual or collective basis of rights and benefits related to employment and for the purpose of the termination of the employment relationship 156 the processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes should be subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject pursuant to this regulation those safeguards should ensure that technical and organisational measures are in place in order to ensure in particular the principle of data minimisation the further processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes is to be carried out when the controller has assessed the feasibility to fulfil those purposes by processing data which do not permit or no longer permit the identification of data subjects provided that appropriate safeguards exist such as for instance pseudonymisation of the data member states should provide for appropriate safeguards for the processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes member states should be authorised to provide under specific conditions and subject to appropriate safeguards for data subjects specifications and derogations with regard to the information requirements and rights to rectification to erasure to be forgotten to restriction of processing to data portability and to object when processing personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes the conditions and safeguards in question may entail specific procedures for data subjects to exercise those rights if this is appropriate in the light of the purposes sought by the specific processing along with technical and organisational measures aimed at minimising the processing of personal data in pursuance of the proportionality and necessity principles the processing of personal data for scientific purposes should also comply with other relevant legislation such as on clinical trials 157 by coupling information from registries researchers can obtain new knowledge of great value with regard to widespread medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease cancer and depression on the basis of registries research results can be enhanced as they draw on a larger population within social science research on the basis of registries enables researchers to obtain essential knowledge about the long-term correlation of a number of social conditions such as unemployment and education with other life conditions research results obtained through registries provide solid high-quality knowledge which can provide the basis for the formulation and implementation of knowledge-based policy improve the quality of life for a number of people and improve the efficiency of social services in order to facilitate scientific research personal data can be processed for scientific research purposes subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards set out in union or member state law 158 where personal data are processed for archiving purposes this regulation should also apply to that processing bearing in mind that this regulation should not apply to deceased persons public authorities or public or private bodies that hold records of public interest should be services which pursuant to union or member state law have a legal obligation to acquire preserve appraise arrange describe communicate promote disseminate and provide access to records of enduring value for general public interest member states should also be authorised to provide for the further processing of personal data for archiving purposes for example with a view to providing specific information related to the political behaviour under former totalitarian state regimes genocide crimes against humanity in particular the holocaust or war crimes 159 where personal data are processed for scientific research purposes this regulation should also apply to that processing for the purposes of this regulation the processing of personal data for scientific research purposes should be interpreted in a broad manner including for example technological development and demonstration fundamental research applied research and privately funded research in addition it should take into account the union 's objective under article 179 1 tfeu of achieving a european research area scientific research purposes should also include studies conducted in the public interest in the area of public health to meet the specificities of processing personal data for scientific research purposes specific conditions should apply in particular as regards the publication or otherwise disclosure of personal data in the context of scientific research purposes if the result of scientific research in particular in the health context gives reason for further measures in the interest of the data subject the general rules of this regulation should apply in view of those measures 160 where personal data are processed for historical research purposes this regulation should also apply to that processing this should also include historical research and research for genealogical purposes bearing in mind that this regulation should not apply to deceased persons 161 for the purpose of consenting to the participation in scientific research activities in clinical trials the relevant provisions of regulation eu no 536/2014 of the european parliament and of the council 15 should apply 162 where personal data are processed for statistical purposes this regulation should apply to that processing union or member state law should within the limits of this regulation determine statistical content control of access specifications for the processing of personal data for statistical purposes and appropriate measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject and for ensuring statistical confidentiality statistical purposes mean any operation of collection and the processing of personal data necessary for statistical surveys or for the production of statistical results those statistical results may further be used for different purposes including a scientific research purpose the statistical purpose implies that the result of processing for statistical purposes is not personal data but aggregate data and that this result or the personal data are not used in support of measures or decisions regarding any particular natural person 163 the confidential information which the union and national statistical authorities collect for the production of official european and official national statistics should be protected european statistics should be developed produced and disseminated in accordance with the statistical principles as set out in article 338 2 tfeu while national statistics should also comply with member state law regulation ec no 223/2009 of the european parliament and of the council 16 provides further specifications on statistical confidentiality for european statistics 164 as regards the powers of the supervisory authorities to obtain from the controller or processor access to personal data and access to their premises member states may adopt by law within the limits of this regulation specific rules in order to safeguard the professional or other equivalent secrecy obligations in so far as necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with an obligation of professional secrecy this is without prejudice to existing member state obligations to adopt rules on professional secrecy where required by union law 165 this regulation respects and does not prejudice the status under existing constitutional law of churches and religious associations or communities in the member states as recognised in article 17 tfeu 166 in order to fulfil the objectives of this regulation namely to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data and to ensure the free movement of personal data within the union the power to adopt acts in accordance with article 290 tfeu should be delegated to the commission in particular delegated acts should be adopted in respect of criteria and requirements for certification mechanisms information to be presented by standardised icons and procedures for providing such icons it is of particular importance that the commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work including at expert level the commission when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts should ensure a simultaneous timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the european parliament and to the council 167 in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this regulation implementing powers should be conferred on the commission when provided for by this regulation those powers should be exercised in accordance with regulation eu no 182/2011 in that context the commission should consider specific measures for micro small and medium-sized enterprises 168 the examination procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts on standard contractual clauses between controllers and processors and between processors codes of conduct technical standards and mechanisms for certification the adequate level of protection afforded by a third country a territory or a specified sector within that third country or an international organisation standard protection clauses formats and procedures for the exchange of information by electronic means between controllers processors and supervisory authorities for binding corporate rules mutual assistance and arrangements for the exchange of information by electronic means between supervisory authorities and between supervisory authorities and the board 169 the commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where available evidence reveals that a third country a territory or a specified sector within that third country or an international organisation does not ensure an adequate level of protection and imperative grounds of urgency so require 170 since the objective of this regulation namely to ensure an equivalent level of protection of natural persons and the free flow of personal data throughout the union can not be sufficiently achieved by the member states and can rather by reason of the scale or effects of the action be better achieved at union level the union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in article 5 of the treaty on european union teu in accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that article this regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective 171 directive 95/46/ec should be repealed by this regulation processing already under way on the date of application of this regulation should be brought into conformity with this regulation within the period of two years after which this regulation enters into force where processing is based on consent pursuant to directive 95/46/ec it is not necessary for the data subject to give his or her consent again if the manner in which the consent has been given is in line with the conditions of this regulation so as to allow the controller to continue such processing after the date of application of this regulation commission decisions adopted and authorisations by supervisory authorities based on directive 95/46/ec remain in force until amended replaced or repealed 172 the european data protection supervisor was consulted in accordance with article 28 2 of regulation ec no 45/2001 and delivered an opinion on 7 march 2012 17 173 this regulation should apply to all matters concerning the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms vis-à-vis the processing of personal data which are not subject to specific obligations with the same objective set out in directive 2002/58/ec of the european parliament and of the council 18 including the obligations on the controller and the rights of natural persons in order to clarify the relationship between this regulation and directive 2002/58/ec that directive should be amended accordingly once this regulation is adopted directive 2002/58/ec should be reviewed in particular in order to ensure consistency with this regulation have adopted this regulation chapter i general

regulation eu no 600/2014 on markets in financial instruments regulation eu no 596/2014 on market abuse and regulation eu no 909/2014 on improving securities settlement in the european union and on central securities depositories text with eea relevance the european parliament and the council of the european union having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the european union and in particular article 114 thereof having regard to the proposal from the european commission after transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments having regard to the opinion of the european central bank 1 having regard to the opinion of the european economic and social committee 2 acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 3 whereas 1 regulation eu no 600/2014 of the european parliament and of the council 4 and directive 2014/65/eu of the european parliament and of the council 5 together ‘ the new legal framework ’ are major financial legislative acts adopted in the wake of the financial crisis as regards securities markets investment intermediaries and trading venues the new legal framework reinforces and replaces directive 2004/39/ec of the european parliament and of the council 6 2 the new legal framework governs the requirements applicable to investment firms regulated markets data reporting services providers and third country firms providing investment services or activities in the union it harmonises the position limits regime for commodity derivatives to improve transparency to support orderly pricing and to prevent market abuse it also introduces rules on high-frequency algorithmic trading and improves the oversight of financial markets by harmonising administrative sanctions building on the rules already in place the new legal framework also strengthens the protection of investors by introducing robust organisational and conduct requirements the new rules are to apply from 3 january 2017 3 the new legal framework requires trading venues and systematic internalisers to provide competent authorities with financial instrument reference data that describe in a uniform manner the characteristics of every financial instrument that is subject to directive 2014/65/eu those data are also used for other purposes for instance for the calculation of transparency and liquidity thresholds as well as for the reporting of positions in commodity derivatives 4 in order to collect data in an efficient and harmonised manner a new data collection infrastructure the financial instruments reference data system ‘ firds ’ is being developed by the european securities and markets authority ‘ esma ’ in conjunction with national competent authorities ‘ ncas ’ firds will cover a wide range of financial instruments brought into the scope of regulation eu no 600/2014 and it will link data feeds between esma ncas and trading venues across the union the vast majority of the new it-systems underpinning firds will need to be built from scratch based on new parameters 5 given the complexity of the new legal framework and the need for a very high number of delegated and implementing acts the date of applicability of regulation eu no 600/2014 was deferred by 30 months from the date of entry into force despite this unusually long period stakeholders such as trading platforms ncas and esma are not in a position to ensure that the necessary data collection infrastructures will be in place and become operational by 3 january 2017. this is due to the size and complexity of the data needed to be collected and processed for the new legal framework to become operational in particular for transaction reporting transparency calculations and the reporting of positions in commodity derivatives 6 the absence of the necessary data collection infrastructures would have implications across the entire scope of the new legal framework without data it would not be feasible to establish a precise delineation of financial instruments that fall within the scope of the new legal framework furthermore it would not be possible to tailor the pre-trade and post-trade transparency rules in order to determine which instruments are liquid and when waivers or deferred publication should be granted 7 in the absence of the necessary data collection infrastructures trading venues and investment firms would not be able to report executed transactions to competent authorities in the absence of reporting of positions in commodity derivatives it would be difficult to enforce position limits on such commodity derivatives with no position reporting there would be limited ability to effectively detect breaches of the position limits many of the requirements in relation to algorithmic trading are also dependent on data 8 the absence of the necessary data collection infrastructures would also make it difficult for investment firms to apply best execution rules trading venues and systematic internalisers would not be able to publish data relating to the quality of execution of transactions on those venues investment firms would not be provided with important execution data to help them determine the best way to execute client orders 9 in order to ensure legal certainty and avoid potential market disruption it is necessary and justified to take urgent action to defer the entry into application of the new legal framework in its entirety including all delegated and implementing acts adopted thereunder 10 the implementation process for the data collection infrastructures involves five steps business requirements specifications development testing and deployment esma estimates that those steps will be completed by january 2018 provided that there is legal certainty on the final requirements under the relevant regulatory technical standards by june 2016 11 in light of the exceptional circumstances and in order to enable esma ncas and stakeholders to complete the operational implementation it is appropriate to defer the date of application of regulation eu no 600/2014 by 12 months until 3 january 2018. reports and reviews should be deferred accordingly 12 investment firms often execute on their own account or on behalf of clients transactions in derivatives and other financial instruments or assets that comprise a number of interlinked contingent trades such package transactions enable investment firms and their clients to better manage their risks with the price of each component of the package transaction reflecting the overall risk profile of the package rather than the prevailing market price of each component package transactions can take various forms such as exchange for physicals trading strategies executed on trading venues or bespoke package transactions and it is important to take those specificities into account when calibrating the applicable transparency regime it is therefore appropriate to specify for the purpose of regulation eu no 600/2014 the specific circumstances in which pre-trade transparency requirements should not apply to orders relating to such package transactions nor to any individual component of such orders 13 as a body with highly specialised expertise it would be efficient and appropriate to entrust esma with the elaboration of draft regulatory technical standards which do not involve policy choices for submission to the commission regarding a methodology for determining those package orders for which there is a liquid market the commission should adopt those draft regulatory technical standards by means of delegated acts pursuant to article 290 of the treaty on the functioning of the union and in accordance with articles 10 to 14 of regulation eu no 1095/2010 of the european parliament and of the council 7 14 it is considered that securities financing transactions as defined in regulation eu 2015/2365 of the european parliament and of the council 8 do not contribute to the price discovery process and that it would be appropriate that title ii and title iii of regulation eu no 600/2014 not apply to those transactions 15 regulation eu no 596/2014 of the european parliament and of the council 9 establishes requirements regarding the collection of financial instrument reference data those data that are collected via firds are used to determine the financial instruments that fall within the scope of regulation eu no 596/2014 regulation eu no 596/2014 applies from 3 july 2016. however firds will not be fully operational before january 2018. it is therefore appropriate to defer the date of application of article 4 2 and 3 of regulation eu no 596/2014 until 3 january 2018 16 regulation eu no 596/2014 contains reference to the date of application of the new legal framework in order to ensure that references in regulation eu no 596/2014 to organised trading facilities small and medium-sized enterprises ‘ sme ’ growth markets emission allowances or auctioned products based thereon do not apply until the date of application of regulation eu no 600/2014 and directive 2014/65/eu article 39 4 of regulation eu no 596/2014 stating that references to them are read as references to directive 2004/39/ec should be adjusted taking into account the extension of the date of application of those acts 17 the settlement of securities transactions is closely linked to securities trading as such regulation eu no 909/2014 of the european parliament and of the council 10 contains references to the date of application of the new legal framework before that date the references to regulation eu no 600/2014 and directive 2014/65/eu should be read as references to directive 2004/39/ec regulation eu no 909/2014 further creates a transitional regime for the application of the rules on settlement discipline to multilateral trading facilities ‘ mtfs ’ applying for registration as sme growth markets in accordance with directive 2014/65/eu 18 in order to ensure that directive 2004/39/ec is referenced in regulation eu no 909/2014 until the extended date of application of the new legal framework and that the transitional provisions for mtfs applying for registration as sme growth markets under regulation eu no 909/2014 are maintained so as to provide sufficient time for mtfs to apply for such registration under directive 2014/65/eu regulation eu no 909/2014 should be amended 19 regulations eu no 600/2014 eu no 596/2014 and eu no 909/2014 should therefore be amended accordingly have adopted this regulation article 1 regulation eu no 600/2014 is amended as follows 1 in article 1 the following paragraph is inserted ‘ 5a title ii and title iii of this regulation shall not apply to securities financing transactions as defined in point 11 of
